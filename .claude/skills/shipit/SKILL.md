description: Branch, commit the code, push it, and make a PR
---

When the code is done and is not building on existing commits:

1. Pull the latest from main.
2. Make a branch using the format $ISSUE_NUMBER-this-describes-the-issue-$ISO-8601-DATE-WITHOUT-DASHES. E.g.: 123-fix-typo-2026-10-17
3. Commit the work to the branch in small logical commits.
4. Push the branch
5. Make a draft PR using the Github Template
