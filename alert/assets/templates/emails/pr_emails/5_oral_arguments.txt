Hi,

We’re very excited to announce today that CourtListener is currently in the process of rolling out support for Oral Argument audio. This is a feature that we’ve wanted for at least four years — our name is CourtListener, after all — and one that will bring a raft of new features to the project. We already have about 500 oral arguments on the site, and we’ve got many more we’re we’ll be adding over the coming weeks.

For now we are getting oral argument audio in real time from ten federal appellate courts. As we get this audio, we are using it to power a number of features:

  - Oral Argument files become immediately available in our search results.

  - A podcast is automatically available for every jurisdiction we support and for any query that you can dream up. Want a custom podcast containing all of the 9th circuit arguments for a particular litigant? You got it.

  - You can now get alerts for oral arguments so you can be sure that you keep up with the latest coming out of the courts.

  - For developers, there are a number of new endpoints in both our REST API and our bulk data API for audio files.

  - Using the Free Law Seal Rookery, we are enhancing the audio we find on court websites by adding album art and better meta data.

We’re very excited about being able to provide oral argument data and have posted more details on our blog:

  - http://freelawproject.org/2014/10/31/announcing-oral-arguments-on-courtlistener-2/

To start using Oral Arguments, simply do a search and switch to the oral arguments tab. From there you can filter by all the fields you expect from CourtListener.

We can’t wait to see what kinds of legal research and innovation these new features bring.
