        <h2>APIs and Bulk Data</h2>
        <p>We currently have two free APIs available to developers using our
            platform. If you are interested in obtaining large quantities of
            our data, we recommend using our <a href="/api/bulk-info/">bulk
                API</a>, which provides compressed JSON files of our entire
            collection, by jurisdiction. If you wish to query our data
            programatically, we recommend using our <a
                    href="/api/rest-info/">REST APIs</a>.

                <p>
                    Over the past several years, we have made a significant investment in
                    making our data the best on the open Web.
                    Among the minor enhancements we make on a regular basis, we've made
                    significant improvements to our data that you won't find in other
                    sources:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We've <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2011/05/25/updated-supreme-court-case-dates-and-the-first-release-of-early-scotus-data-in-machine-readable-form/">
                        added exact dates from the library of congress</a> to our collection
                        of older Supreme Court cases, enhancing thousands of cases beyond what's
                        available anywhere else.
                    </li>
                    <li>When we imported the Resource.org data, we <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2011/08/25/second-series-of-federal-reporter-from-1950-to-1993-now-on-courtlistener/">
                        manually corrected</a> more than ten thousand omissions or
                        errors in the data, ensuring that it's complete and accurate.
                    </li>
                    <li>Our data has <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2012/05/11/building-a-citator-on-courtlistener/">
                        the citation network</a>, showing which cases reference each
                        other, saving you the effort of building and testing a citation
                        finding and matching algorithm yourself. Currently, we're working with
                        researchers at USC to complete an audit of the citation network, the
                        results of which will be folded back into our corpus.
                    </li>
                    <li>We complete complicated cleanup routines on the data, eliminating and
                        fixing errant abbreviations like 'et al', 'U.S.A.' and the like.
                    </li>
                    <li>The data on CourtListener is a combination of many partial sources such
                        as court websites, <a href="https://public.resource.org/">Public.Resource.Org</a>,
                        and a donation from <a href="http://lawboxapps.com">Lawbox LLC.</a>
                        This means that we have the best parts of all of our sources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We help you identify opinions that should be private. Many people don't want their
                        case on the Web and have contacted us or Resource.org. In our data
                        we provide a field indicating which cases should be kept private. In
                        addition, we provide research about how to keep these cases out of
                        search engines (more detail at right).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3 id="fields">Important notes about document fields</h3>
                <p>Whether you use our bulk data or our REST API, the most frequent question we
                   receive is people wondering what the different document fields mean and why they are
                   sometimes populated and sometimes not. Here are the details:</p>
                <p>We have a source field to indicate the source of the document/audio file, one of: 
                   C (court website), R (public.resource.org), CR (court website merged with resource.org), 
                   L (lawbox), LC (lawbox merged with court), LR (lawbox merged with resource.org), 
                   LCR (lawbox merged with court and resource.org), M (manual input), A (internet archive),
                   or H (brad heath archive).</p>
                <p>The source field gives you an idea where you might find document text. We have
                   several fields that may or may not be used, depending on our source. There is:
                   <ol>
                      <li>a <code>plain_text</code> field: This is always created (usually from a pdf via pdftotext) 
                          so that we can put the plain text into the search engine.
                          There's very rarely a court that actually posts opinions in plain text, so in 
                          those instances it might even reflect the original source document.
                      </li>
                      <li>a <code>html</code> field: This is used when the original document we received was already 
                          in HTML format. This happens when the courts themselves provide the documents in 
                          HTML format and includes the documents we got from Public.Resource.Org.
                      </li>
                      <li>a <code>html_lawbox</code> field: This is the original format of over a million opinions we 
                          got from LawBox.
                      </li>
                      <li>a <code>html_with_citations</code> field: This is the field we use to put our processed 
                          version of the opinion in and except for maybe the first hour after we retrieve 
                          an opinion is always the version displayed on the website. We scan the opinion 
                          for citations and then hyperlink them to our copies of those cited opinions. Note 
                          that because recent opinions typically come from PDF and pdftotext doesn't do much 
                          to maintain a nice structure, we typically have to just wrap the entire opinion in 
                          PRE tags (and nothing else), so this is "HTML" in a very weak sense of the acronym. 
                          Only if we got the opinion (from the court in HTML, from LawBox in HTML, or from 
                          Public.Resource.Org in HTML) might this field contain prettier markup that makes 
                          the opinion actually look nice online. Most of the documents we archive come as PDFs
                          and so they look pretty ugly on our site. We've wanted to fix this for years, but 
                          other demands always intruded... <em>This is the only field that is always guaranteed to 
                          have content, and therefore most likely the field you want to use for most purposes.</em>

                <h3 id="privacy">Privacy Concerns</h3>
                <p>As is explained in our <a href="/removal/">removal policy</a>, we
                    have blocked public search engines from indexing many of the cases available
                    in our data (though they remain in our search engine).
                    As you work with this data, please be cognizant of the privacy and safety
                    issues involved with public-facing legal documents. This impacts real people
                    with privacy issues such as jailed informants, women avoiding stalkers,
                    foreign citizens with rejected asylum requests, children who were named
                    incidentally in a case about their parent's wrongdoings, etc.</p>

                <p>If you intend to respect the privacy wishes of the parties involved,
                    there is a field for each case, "<strong>blocked</strong>," which
                    describes whether we have blocked search engines from indexing the
                    case. The simple thing for you to do is to continue blocking
                    such cases.</p>

                <p>For our approach to blocking, please see our <a href="/removal/">removal
                    policy</a>. For our technical approach, please see the blog entries below. If
                    you believe Robots.txt prevents a URL from appearing in search results,
                    please be sure to check these out (it likely does not work as you expect):
