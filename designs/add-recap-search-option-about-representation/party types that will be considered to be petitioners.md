[This proposed change](./readme.md) will include Django code that will examine each docket party's type to determine if the party is what we will consider to be a petitioner.

In the list below, the party types that the Django code will consider to identify a petitioner are `highlighted like this` <<<<<.

The list's 316 party type names are from a FreeLawProject Slack message that contained a list of all party types that had been seen before November 6, 2017.

At a high level, the Django code will use the same kinds of comparisons to identify petitioners that are used within the following SQL statement's WHERE clause.  (This SQL is only to illustrate what the Django script will do.  This SQL will not be used in the proposed solution.)

``` sql
SELECT name
FROM people_db_party
WHERE
-- Appellants
   (people_db_party.name ILIKE '%Appellant%'
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%Cross%'
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%Defendant%')
-- Applicants
OR (people_db_party.name ILIKE '%Applicant%')
-- Complainants
OR (people_db_party.name ILIKE '%Complainant%')
-- Claimants
OR (people_db_party.name ILIKE '%Claimant%' 
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%Cross%' 
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%Counter%')
- Creditors
OR (people_db_party.name ILIKE '%Creditor%')
-- Petitioners
OR (people_db_party.name ILIKE '%Petition%'
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%venor%' -- catch spellings Intevenor and Intervenor
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%Non-Party%')
-- Plaintiffs
OR (people_db_party.name ILIKE '%Plaintiff%' 
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%venor%' 
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%Counter%'
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%Party%'
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%Cross%'
    AND people_db_party.name NOT ILIKE '%Appellee%')
-- Relators
