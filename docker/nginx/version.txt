0.0.22

0.0.22: Add redirection support for RECAP PDFs.
0.0.21: Add recap-thumbnails to storage.cl.com redirection. This also remvoes
        our last usage of the X-Accel-Redirect, and thus removes the
        /protected/ location block. If we want to serve static files again
        someday, we'll want it back.
0.0.20: Add PDFs and other opinion-related content to storage.cl.com redirection
0.0.19: Create new location block for audio file redirection
0.0.18: Add no-index headers to /protected/ location
0.0.17: Stop blocking Allen v. Chanel
0.0.16: Remove HSTS header from HTTP response (it does nothing there).
0.0.15: Redirect http to root https, then to www (Google's HSTS recommends
        this).
0.0.14: Add security headers to other subdomains
0.0.13: Fix bug in HSTS config
0.0.12: Remove X-Frame-Option header and add security headers to location block
