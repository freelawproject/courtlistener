Report of Old or Expiring Docket Alerts

This email lists docket alerts on long-dormant cases that you may want to
disable or that have been automatically disabled by our systems.

Disabling these alerts will prevent them from counting towards your quota and
will help ease the load on our servers.

Your alerts on the cases below have been automatically disabled. These
terminated cases haven't had updates for over 180 days. If these alerts were
