Dillard, for respondent.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nCHIECHI, Judge:    Respondent determined the following defi-\nciencies in, and additions to, petitioner's Federal income tax\n(tax):\n- 2 -\nAdditions to Tax\nYear   Deficiency        Sec. 6651(a)1   Sec. 6654(a)\n1994    $20,835            $3,084              $303\n1995      7,778               195               424\nThe only issues remaining for decision are whether peti-\ntioner is liable for 1994 for the additions to tax under sections\n6651(a) and 6654(a).       We hold that he is.\nSome of the facts have been stipulated and are so found.\nPetitioner resided in Indialantic, Florida, at the time the\npetition was filed.\nAt all relevant times, petitioner worked as a catastrophe\ninsurance claims adjuster.       His income from that work depended,\ninter alia, upon whether there was bad weather.      Given the nature\nof petitioner's work, it was difficult for him to determine the\namount of income that he would earn from year to year.\nPetitioner filed his 1994 tax return on or about October 3,\n1997.    Petitioner contends that the reason that he filed his 1994\nreturn late was because he wanted to make sure that he completed\nthat return accurately, and he was concerned that if he filed an\ninaccurate return, he would be penalized.\nPetitioner claims that he made estimated tax payments with\nrespect to the income that he expected to earn for 1994.         He\n1\nAll section references are to the Internal Revenue Code\nin effect for the years at issue. All Rule references are to the\nTax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure.\n- 3 -\nfurther contends that one of the reasons why he did not make the\nappropriate amount of estimated tax payments for 1994 related to\ncertain unresolved tax issues for 1993 that were pending before\nthe Internal Revenue Service.\nPetitioner has the burden to show that he is not liable for\nthe additions to tax under sections 6651(a) and 6654(a).    Rule\n142(a); Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115 (1933).\nSection 6651(a)(1) imposes an addition to tax for failure to\nfile timely a tax return.     The addition to tax does not apply if\nthe failure is due to reasonable cause, and not to willful\nneglect.   Sec. 6651(a)(1).   Petitioner suggested at trial that\none of the reasons that he did not timely file his 1994 return\nwas because he did not know the amount of his income for 1994 as\nof the time that return was due.    We find that explanation hard\nto believe, since petitioner is presumably a cash basis taxpayer\nwho would have known the amount of income that he earned during\n1994 well before the due date of his 1994 return.    In any event,\nunavailability of information or records does not necessarily\nestablish reasonable cause for failure to file timely.    See\nElectric & Neon, Inc. v. Commissioner, 56 T.C. 1324, 1342-1344\n(1971), affd. without published opinion 496 F.2d 876 (5th Cir.\n1974).   A taxpayer is required to file timely based on the best\ninformation available and to file thereafter an amended return if\nnecessary.   Estate of Vriniotis v. Commissioner, 79 T.C. 298, 311\n- 4 -\n(1982).    Nothing in the record suggests that petitioner applied\nfor an extension of time to file his 1994 return.   Petitioner did\nnot show that as of the due date of his 1994 return he did not\nhave information showing the amount of his income for 1994.    Nor\ndid he establish that he could not have prepared a timely 1994\nreturn with a reasonable degree of accuracy based on the informa-\ntion available to him as of the due date of that return.    On the\nrecord before us, we find that petitioner has not demonstrated\nthat the failure to file timely his 1994 return was due to\nreasonable cause, and not to willful neglect.   We further find on\nthat record that petitioner is liable for 1994 for the addition\nto tax under section 6651(a)(1).\nSection 6654(a) imposes an addition to tax in the case of\nany underpayment of estimated tax by an individual.   The addition\nto tax under section 6654(a) is mandatory unless petitioner\nqualifies under one of the exceptions in section 6654(e).    See\nGrosshandler v. Commissioner, 75 T.C. 1, 20-21 (1980).     Peti-\ntioner claims that he made estimated tax payments with respect to\nthe income that he expected to earn for 1994 and that one of the\nreasons why he did not make the appropriate amount of estimated\ntax payments for that year related to certain unresolved tax\nissues for 1993 that were pending before the Internal Revenue\nService.    Petitioner does not argue, and did not prove, that he\nqualifies under any of the exceptions listed in section 6654(e).\n- 5 -\nOn the instant record, we find that petitioner failed to prove\nthat he is not liable for 1994 for the addition to tax under\nsection 6654(a).\nTo reflect the foregoing and the concessions by the parties,\nDecision will be entered\nunder Rule 155.\n",
