COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE,                                                                RESPONDENT                                                    Docket No. 4775–11.                         Filed August 9, 2012.                                                 P timely filed his 2008 Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income                                               Tax Return, after previously filing a Form 1040–ES, Esti-                                               mated Tax, and paying $4,000 in estimated taxes. On his                                               Form 1040, P mistakenly added the $4,000 estimated tax pay-                                               ment to the income tax withheld reported on line 62 instead                                               of the estimated tax payments reported on line 63. That mis-                                               take contributed to R’s issuance of a refund to P on May 11,                                               2009. R later realized that P had reported the $4,000 esti-                                               mated tax payment on line 62, and R subsequently informed                                               P that he owed $4,000 plus a penalty and interest. P filed a                                               request for abatement, and R granted P’s request to abate the                                               penalty but denied P’s request to abate the interest. Held:                                               Even though the refund was recoverable by assessment and                                               levy procedures, the refund also would have been recoverable                                               by filing a civil suit pursuant to I",

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Respondent          Docket No. 8967-16S.                          Filed June 24, 2019.          Herald J. A. Alexander, for petitioners.        David Delduco and Huiwen A. Xi, for respondent.                                  SUMMARY OPINION         HALPERN, Judge: This case was heard pursuant to the provisions of  section 74631 of the Internal Revenue Code in effect when the petition was filed.          1       Unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and in effect for 2013, and all Rule references                                                                        (continued...)                                           -2-  Pursuant to section 7463(b), the decision to be entered is not reviewable by any  other court, and this opinion shall not be treated as precedent for any other case.  Respondent determined a deficiency in petitioners' 2013 Federal income tax of  $5,838 and an accuracy-related penalty of $1,168. Petitioners assigned error to  respondent's determination of the deficiency in tax but not to respondent's  determination of the accuracy-related penalty. Principally, we must determine  petitioners' entitlement to certain itemized deductions.                                      Background        Petitioners resided in Florida when they filed the petition. The parties have  stipulated certain facts and the authenticity of certain documents. The facts  stipulated are so found, and documents stipulated are accepted as authentic.  Petitioners bear the burden of proof. See Rule 142(a)(1).2           1         (...continued) are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure. All dollar amounts have been rounded to the nearest dollar.       2        Petitioners have not raised the applicability of sec. 7491(a), which shifts the burden of proof to the Commissioner in certain situations. We conclude that sec. 7491(a) does not apply here because petitioners have not produced any evidence that they have satisfied the preconditions for its application.                                         -3-  Employment        In 2013, Ms. Torres was employed by United Airlines as a flight attendant,  and Mr. Burden was employed as a pastor by Allegheny West Conference of  Seventh-Day Adventists (AWC). AWC is one of eight local conferences in the  mid-Atlantic States of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania,  Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. AWC's territory includes  Ohio, western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, specific sections of Virginia, and the  tip end of Maryland.        In 2013, Pastor Burden received a salary from AWC. It also provided him  with an office at Ephesus SDA Church in Columbus, Ohio, and it maintained two  plans for reimbursing an employee's business-related travel expenses: an  accountable plan and a nonaccountable plan.  Travel        During 2013, Pastor Burden traveled within the United States to  Montgomery, Alabama; Charleston, West Virginia; Baltimore, Maryland;  Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Newark, New Jersey; Orlando, Florida; and  Roanoke, Virginia. Pastor Burden's mother lived in Montgomery, Alabama, and  he and his mother owned property there.                                          -4-        During 2013, petitioners traveled twice to the Dominican Republic, once in  January and again in September. Ms. Torres had family living there. While there,  Pastor Burden engaged in recreational activities and went sightseeing and to the  beaches. During the January trip, he conducted a revival ceremony.        Petitioners also traveled to Johannesburg, South Africa, for two weeks in  2013. Pastor Burden testified that he had been invited to South Africa to do  morning devotions, speak on various occasions, and assist with both a naming  ceremony and a wedding renewal ceremony. He traveled to South Africa with a  group consisting of members of his congregation and others. While there, Pastor  Burden gave a prayer of dedication during a renewal of vows ceremony. He and  Ms. Torres visited the Apartheid Museum, the Robben Island Museum, Nelson  Mandela's residences in Johannesburg and Soweto, Bishop Tutu's residence, and  the botanical gardens.  Petitioners' Return and Respondent's Adjustments        Petitioners made a joint return of income for their 2013 taxable year on  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.  On Schedule A, Itemized Deductions, they claimed deductions of $41,950 for  unreimbursed employee expenses and $250 for tax preparation fees. Respondent  disallowed the whole of the deduction for tax preparation fees and $40,741 of the                                            -5-  deduction for unreimbursed employee expenses. The disallowed employee  business expenses comprise $20,334 of vehicle expenses (which petitioners  determined using a standard mileage rate); $75 of parking fees, tolls, and local  transportation expenses; $10,897 of travel expenses, including lodging, airfares,  car rentals, and other travel expenses; $5,444 of miscellaneous business expenses  not including meals and entertainment; $2,904 of meals and entertainment  expenses ($1,452 after the 50% limitation); $480 of union and professional  association dues; $1,440 for a \"crash pad\"; and $619 for \"special shoes\".                                       Discussion  I.    Introduction        At the conclusion of the trial, the Court set a briefing schedule and ordered  seriatim briefs, with petitioners to file the opening brief. We instructed petitioners'  counsel that, since much of the case turns on whether petitioners have satisfied the  requirements of section 274 for substantiating traveling expenses and automobile  expenses, he should be sure to familiarize himself with those requirements and, in  petitioners' brief, for each claimed deduction subject to the requirements, show  how the requirements were met. We suggested that the brief contain a table with  columns in which he would show the expenses disallowed by respondent, the  elements necessary for substantiation of each expense (e.g., the business purpose                                           -6-  of the expense), and a reference to the place in the record where support for each  entry could be found.        We also instructed petitioners' counsel to familiarize himself with our Rules  governing the content of briefs. Rule 151(e) addresses the form and content of  briefs and, among other things, requires all briefs to contain proposed findings of  fact, \"[a] concise statement of the points on which the party relies\", and the party's  \"argument\" on each issue before the Court. That argument must \"set[] forth and  discuss[] the points of law involved and any disputed questions of fact.\" Rule  151(e)(5). Petitioners' opening brief does contain proposed findings of fact  (mostly a recitation of stipulated facts) and arguably describes the points on which  petitioners rely: \"This is purely a substantiation case. Substantiation of the  expenses * * * [is in] the substantiating [stipulated] documents.\" And while  petitioners apply the heading \"Argument\" to the two quoted sentences, petitioners'  statement that substantiation is in the stipulated documents does not comply with  the mandate of Rule 151(e)(5) that a party in his brief discuss the \"points of law  involved and any disputed questions of fact.\" Nor have petitioners provided the  tabular data we suggested (or any other presentation showing application of the  substantiation rules to the expenses deducted).                                           -7-        We have authority under Rule 123(a) to hold petitioners or any party in  default if the party fails to proceed as provided by the Rules or as required by the  Court. Citing Rule 151(e)(3) and (5), we have held a party to have waived a  substantiation issue that it supported on brief with only vague assertions.  Adeyemo v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2014-1, at *28. We will not dismiss this  case for default, however, but will look to petitioners' proposed findings of fact  and consider respondent's arguments in his answering brief. Petitioners filed a  reply brief, but it does not remedy the defects in their opening brief.        We will proceed by first discussing relevant provisions of law and then turn  to the particular items respondent disallowed.  II.   Law        Section 162(a) allows a taxpayer to deduct all ordinary and necessary  expenses paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business, including traveling  expenses while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business. The  performance of services as an employee is considered a trade or business. Primuth  v. Commissioner, 54 T.C. 374, 377 (1970). Thus, an employee may deduct  expenses that are ordinary and necessary to his employment. Lucas v.  Commissioner, 79 T.C. 1, 6 (1982). In order to deduct unreimbursed employee  business expenses, a taxpayer must not have received reimbursement and must not                                            -8-  have had the right to obtain reimbursement from his employer. See id. at 7. A  trade or business expense is ordinary if it is normal or customary within a  particular trade, business, or industry, and it is necessary if it is appropriate and  helpful for the development of the business. Commissioner v. Heininger, 320 U.S.  467, 471 (1943). Whether an expenditure is ordinary and necessary is generally a  question of fact. Id. at 475. Section 262(a) provides that, in general, personal,  living, or family expenses are not deductible. If a taxpayer travels to a destination  and, while at that destination, engages in both business and personal activities,  then the traveling expenses to that destination are deductible only if the trip is  primarily related to the taxpayer's trade or business. Sec. 1.162-2(b)(1), Income  Tax Regs.        Generally, when a taxpayer establishes that he paid or incurred a deductible  expense but is unable to prove the exact amount, the Tax Court may estimate the  deductible expense. Cohan v. Commissioner, 39 F.2d 540, 543-544 (2d Cir.  1930). However, there must be sufficient evidence in the record to provide some  basis upon which an estimate may be made. Id. In estimating the amount, the Tax  Court bears heavily upon the taxpayer who failed to maintain and produce the  required records. Id.                                            -9-        The deductibility of some expenses, however, including expenses  attributable to travel, meals and entertainment, and \"listed property\" (including  computers and passenger automobiles), is subject to strict rules of substantiation.  See sec. 274(d); Sanford v. Commissioner, 50 T.C. 823, 827 (1968), aff'd per  curiam, 412 F.2d 201 (2d Cir. 1969); sec. 1.274-5T(a), Temporary Income Tax  Regs., 50 Fed. Reg. 46014 (Nov. 6, 1985).        A deduction that falls under the strict substantiation rules must be  disallowed in full unless the taxpayer can prove by \"adequate records\" or  \"sufficient evidence\" corroborating the taxpayer's own statement: (A) the amount  of the expense; (B) the time and place the expense was incurred; (C) the business  purpose of the expense; and (D) in the case of meals and entertainment, the  business relationship to the taxpayer of the persons entertained. Sec. 274(d). For  \"listed property\" expenses, the taxpayer must establish the amount of the business  use and the amount of total use for such property. See sec. 1.274-5T(b)(6)(i)(B),  Temporary Income Tax Regs., 50 Fed. Reg. 46016 (Nov. 6, 1985).        Substantiation by \"adequate records\" requires the taxpayer to maintain an  account book, a diary, a log, a statement of expense, trip sheets, or a similar record  prepared contemporaneously with the expenditure and to have documentary  evidence (e.g., receipts or bills) of certain expenditures. Sec. 1.274-5(c)(2)(iii),                                         -10-  Income Tax Regs.; sec. 1.274-5T(c)(2), Temporary Income Tax Regs., 50 Fed.  Reg. 46017 (Nov. 6, 1985). Substantiation by other \"sufficient evidence\" requires  the production of corroborative evidence in support of the taxpayer's statement  specifically detailing the required elements. Sec. 1.274-5T(c)(3)(i), Temporary  Income Tax Regs., 50 Fed. Reg. 46020 (Nov. 6, 1985).         The Tax Court does not estimate expenses using the Cohan doctrine for  section 274 expenses. Sanford v. Commissioner, 50 T.C. at 827-828; Robinson v.  Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2011-99, 2011 WL 1758518, at *9, aff'd, 487  F. App'x 751 (3d Cir. 2012).  III.   Analysis         A.    Vehicle Expenses         Petitioners claimed a deduction of $20,334 for vehicle expenses incurred by  Pastor Burden. Petitioners determined that amount by applying a standard mileage  rate to the 35,989 miles that they claim he drove for business purposes during  2013. To substantiate the mileage claimed, petitioners produced a calendar log  and a mileage log. The calendar log shows 43,996 business miles, and the mileage  log shows 44,093 business miles.         To be allowed a deduction for mileage, section 274(d) requires the taxpayer  to prove by adequate records or evidence sufficient to corroborate the taxpayer's                                          -11-  own testimony: (1) the amount of the expenditure or use, (2) the time and place of  the business use, and (3) the business purpose.        Respondent argues that the logs fail to substantiate adequately the mileage  claimed under the strict substantiation requirements of section 274(d). First, he  claims the logs are not reliable because they are not in agreement as to the  business miles traveled during the year and petitioners have offered no explanation  of the discrepancy. Second, he claims that neither log was prepared or maintained  contemporaneously with the travel recorded. Indeed, Pastor Burden testified that  there was another record, \"a small calendar\", that contained the source information  for the calendar and the mileage log. Petitioners, however, did not produce the  small calendar. Third, respondent claims the logs lack specificity as to the starting  and ending points of the trips reported. Fourth, respondent claims that the logs  contain patently wrong or dubious entries. For instance, respondent points out, the  logs purport that Pastor Burden drove for business purposes 360 days out of 365  days during 2013, and, on average, he drove more than 100 business miles a day in  and around Columbus, Ohio. The travel log also appears to indicate that Pastor  Burden drove to and from the Dominican Republic, once in January 2013, leaving  on a Sunday and returning the next Wednesday, and again in September 2013,  leaving on a Sunday and returning eight days later. And the log also indicates he                                           -12-  drove to and from South Africa in December 2013. Also, while the logs claim  business trips to Alabama, Florida, and Texas, petitioners failed to produce gas  receipts or other records that would substantiate that the travel actually occurred.  They also offered nothing other than Pastor Burden's testimony to prove the  business purpose of any of the trips.        In sum, respondent argues:        [A]lthough it is conceivable that * * * [Pastor Burden] drove some       number of miles in connection with his job, there is insufficient       evidence in the record to make a finding as to the exact number of       miles driven. Petitioners' logs were inaccurate, they were not       contemporaneous, and they lack the specificity required for a       deduction under section 274(d). Since the Court cannot apply the       Cohan doctrine to estimate mileage under section 274(d), the vehicle       expenses should be disallowed in full. Robinson v. Commissioner,       T.C. Memo. 2011-99; Sanford v. Commissioner, 50 T.C. * * * [at]       827-828 * * * .        Petitioners in their reply brief do not answer respondent's arguments. As  best we can tell, their defense to the irregularities and omissions that respondent  points out in the logs is that \"[t]he evidence is uncontradicted that to assure that  the mileage was not overstated, fewer miles were used to compute the deduction  [than were actually recorded in the logs].\"        Respondent points out systematic omissions in petitioners' substantiation of  the miles recorded in their logs, and the fact that petitioners claimed a deduction                                          -13-  for only a portion of those miles does nothing to prove that the miles for which  they claimed a deduction were properly substantiated. We will sustain  respondent's adjustment disallowing petitioners a deduction for vehicle expenses  of $20,334.        B.      Transportation Expenses        Petitioners claimed a deduction of $75 for parking fees, tolls, and local  transportation expenses incurred by Pastor Burden that did not involve overnight  travel or commuting. Because petitioners have failed to introduce any testimony,  records, or other evidence showing payment of the claimed transportation  expenses, they have failed to carry their burden of proving that such expenses  were incurred or were incurred for a business purpose. We will sustain  respondent's adjustment disallowing petitioners a deduction for transportation  expenses of $75.        C.      Traveling Expenses        Petitioners claimed a deduction of $10,897 for traveling expenses incurred  by Pastor Burden. He testified that the amount included expenses of both his  domestic and international travel during 2013. Petitioners did not, however,  further break the amount down, nor did they offer any bills, receipts, or other  records to substantiate Pastor Burden's domestic traveling expenses. Moreover,                                          -14-  they apparently did not claim a deduction for all of Pastor Burden's traveling  expenses, alleging: \"Days away from home on ministerial duties 100 days @ $180  per day using conservative high low method = $18,000.\" Petitioners do not  explain what they mean by the \"conservative high low method\". Petitioners'  unsupported claim for some indeterminate amount of domestic traveling expense  does not constitute the substantiation contemplated by section 274(d). See sec.  1.274-5T(b)(2), (c), Temporary Income Tax Regs., 50 Fed. Reg. 46014, 46016  (Nov. 6, 1985). Besides, they did not provide a copy of AWC's reimbursable  travel plan and did not show that, if Pastor Burden's domestic travel was related to  his pastoral duties, he was not entitled to reimbursement under that plan. If Pastor  Burden was entitled to reimbursement for his domestic travel, then, as discussed  supra, his traveling expenses would not have been necessary expenses deductible  under section 162(a). See, e.g., Lucas v. Commissioner, 79 T.C. at 7. Petitioners  have failed to substantiate adequately or otherwise prove their entitlement to  deduct any amount for Pastor Burden's 2013 domestic traveling expenses.        Petitioners have presented evidence of the cost of their trip to Johannesburg,  South Africa. We have an invoice showing the payment of $1,590 for airfare for  Pastor Burden dated July 15, 2013. We also have an invoice in the amount of  $3,300 for his travel to South Africa to be paid by September 6, 2013. While in                                            -15-  South Africa, Pastor Burden gave a prayer of dedication during a renewal of vows  ceremony. He also engaged in what we assume to be sightseeing activities: He  visited the Apartheid Museum, the Robben Island Museum, Nelson Mandela's  residences in Johannesburg and Soweto, Bishop Tutu's residence, and the  botanical gardens. For Pastor Burden's traveling expenses to South Africa to be  deductible, however, petitioners would have to show that the trip primarily related  to his trade or business (i.e., his pastoral responsibilities). That they have failed to  do.        Pastor Burden's calendar and mileage logs contain little more than  annotations that he traveled to South Africa between December 2 and 14, 2013.  And while he testified that he carried out daily devotions with the people who  accompanied him on the trip and, during the rest of the trip \"[t]here were other  engagements, such as the wedding renewal[,] * * * [a] naming ceremony, * * *  [and] speaking engagements\", his testimony was too vague for us to conclude that  the trip primarily related to his pastoral responsibilities. Likewise with the trips to  the Dominican Republic, where, although he conducted a revival ceremony, his  wife had family and he engaged in recreational activities and went sightseeing.  Petitioners have failed to show that Pastor Burden's travel in 2013 either to the  Dominican Republic or to South Africa primarily related to his trade or business.                                          -16-  We conclude that his traveling expenses were personal expenses and not  deductible for Federal income tax purposes. See sec. 262(a); sec. 1.162-2(b)(1),  Income Tax Regs.3        We will sustain respondent's adjustment disallowing petitioners a deduction  for traveling expenses of $10,897.        D.     Miscellaneous Business Expenses Not Including Meals and              Entertainment        Respondent disallowed petitioners' claimed deduction of $5,444 for  miscellaneous business expenses. Petitioners allege that Pastor Burden incurred  the following business expenses, totaling $7,148, in 2013: office furniture,  $2,990; computers, $2,126; cell phone charges, $1,440; internet usage, $492; and  ink or paper, $100.        Pastor Burden testified that, in 2013, he paid $2,990 for a desk, a credenza,  file cabinets, and bookcases for his home office in petitioners' basement, which he  used for ministry business. Petitioners have substantiated that, in 2013, Pastor  Burden paid $2,963 for furniture, which we find to be the cost of the furniture  described. And while petitioners claimed no home office deduction, we also find        3        We note in passing that, in connection with Pastor Burden's travel to the Dominican Republic, the only expenditure for which petitioners presented evidence of an amount paid was $51 for an airfare departure tax (which, nevertheless, is insufficient evidence of business travel to get them a deduction).                                           -17-  that Pastor Burden used the furniture for business purposes. Office furniture is a  capital asset, and, barring an election under section 179, petitioners were not  entitled to deduct for 2013 the full cost of the furniture. See secs. 167(a),  263(a)(1)(G); Ellis Banking Corp. v. Commissioner, 688 F.2d 1376, 1379 (11th  Cir. 1982), aff'g in part, remanding in part on other grounds T.C. Memo. 1981-  123. Petitioners' accountant testified at trial that he had not capitalized the cost of  the furniture because he \"just used the 179 deduction.\" Section 179(a) provides an  election to treat the cost of certain property as an expense not chargeable to a  capital account. The election is made on IRS Form 4562, Depreciation and  Amortization, which, the form specifies, is to be attached to the taxpayer's return.  A taxpayer who fails to make the election is denied the benefits of section 179.  E.g., Jackson v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2008-70, 2008 WL 731318, at *7.  Petitioners have not shown that they made a section 179 election with respect to  the office furniture. We leave it to the Rule 155 computations to calculate the  deduction (if any, given the section 67 limitation on miscellaneous itemized  deductions) to which petitioners are entitled.        Pastor Burden testified, and we find, that, on July 2 and September 17,  2013, he paid $1,066 and $1,199 for two computers, a laptop and a desktop,  respectively. When asked by his counsel whether he used the computers for any                                          -18-  personal purposes, he responded that he did not use the desktop computer for  personal purposes. For 2013, section 280F(d)(4)(A)(iv) subjected computers to  the special substantiation requirements of section 274 as \"listed property\".4  Petitioners offer nothing (and have not even addressed the issue on brief) to satisfy  the substantiation requirements for listed property by showing business purpose  and business use for the two computers. See sec. 1.274-5T(c)(1), Temporary  Income Tax Regs., 50 Fed. Reg. 46016 (Nov. 6, 1985). We, therefore, allow  petitioners no deduction for the cost of either computer.        Petitioners could produce no cell phone bills for 2013. To support their  deduction of a 2013 cell phone expense petitioners provide a page of a cell phone  bill showing a charge of $126 for one month in 2015 for a phone number in Pastor  Burden's name on a family-plan account billed to Ms. Torres. While Pastor  Burden testified that he used the phone in his work to make and receive calls from  his congregants, petitioners offered no evidence that he was required by his         4         Computers and peripheral equipment are excepted from the definition of \"listed property\" if \"used exclusively at a regular business establishment and owned * * * by the person operating such establishment.\" Sec. 280F(d)(4)(B). A home office qualifies as a regular business establishment \"if (and only if) the requirements of section 280A(c)(1) are met\" with respect to that space. Id. Since petitioners have not shown that they meet the requirements of sec. 280A(c)(1) for the deduction of home office expenses, the exception set forth in sec. 280F(d)(4)(B) is inapplicable here.                                          -19-  employer to have a cell phone, that he would not have had a cell phone  independent of any business use of it by him, or of how much he used his phone  for business purposes and how much he used it for personal purposes.        Cell phones were no longer listed property under section 280F for 2013;  therefore, petitioners are not required with respect to any cell phone expense to  meet the strict substantiation requirements of section 274(d). They must, however,  still substantiate that Pastor Burden used his cell phone for business and provide  credible evidence as to the cost of the phone service and of the portion of his use  of the phone for business purposes. See Windham v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo.  2017-68, at *23 n.18. Petitioners have provided no evidentiary basis for applying  the Cohan rule to Pastor Burden's cell phone expenses. Therefore, we will allow  petitioners no deduction for any cell phone expense. See id. at *24.        Petitioners produced a cable bill for cable TV and internet services at their  home for one month in 2015 showing a charge of $41 for the internet service.  They had no bills for 2013. While Pastor Burden testified that he used the internet  for work, he offered no testimony or other evidence from which we could estimate  his usage for work apart from his and Ms. Torres' usage for personal purposes.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Respondent    Docket No. 4243-12L.                         Filed November 24, 2014.           P, a sculptor who works in cast bronze and sells his artwork through a wholly owned S corporation, filed a Federal income tax return for 2007 on which he self-reported a tax due of $163,928 that he failed to remit with his return. R assessed the unpaid tax plus certain additions to tax and interest, which totaled more than $200,000 and, thereafter, issued a notice of intent to levy. P requested and received a collection due process (CDP) hearing, which resulted in his agreeing with the Appeals officer on the terms of an installment agreement for full payment of his assessed liability. On the basis of her interpretation of relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) the Appeals officer insisted upon the filing of a notice of lien as a condition of entering into the installment agreement. P argued that a notice of lien would destroy his sculpting business, rendering him unable to satisfy the terms of the installment agreement, and he rejected the Appeals officer's proposal. Appeals then issued a notice of determination sustaining the notice of levy and authorizing collection by levy of the assessed liability. P filed a                                          -2-        [*2] petition with this Court pursuant to I.R.C. sec. 6330(d)(1)       alleging that the Appeals officer abused her discretion by       misinterpreting the requirements of the IRM and believing she had no       choice but to require that a notice of lien be filed in conjunction with       the installment agreement.              1. Held: The Appeals officer erroneously concluded that the       IRM required the filing of a notice of lien in the circumstances of this       case.              2. Held, further, as a result, the Appeals officer failed to       properly balance the need for the efficient collection of P's liability       with P's legitimate concern that collection action be no more intrusive       than necessary as required by I.R.C. sec. 6330(c)(3)(C).               3. Held, further, Appeals' determination to sustain the notice of       levy and proceed with collection by levy is rejected and the case will       be remanded to Appeals for a supplemental CDP hearing with       directions to perform the balancing of factors required by I.R.C. sec.       6330(c)(3)(C) before determining the appropriate collection action.          Theodore H. Merriam, Kevin A. Planegger, and Olena Ruth, for petitioner.        Michael T. Garrett, Sara J. Barkley, and Matthew A. Houtsma, for  respondent.                  MEMORANDUM FINDINGS OF FACT AND OPINION         HALPERN, Judge: This case is before the Court to review a determination  by the Internal Revenue Service's Appeals Office (Appeals) following a collection                                           -3-  [*3] due process (CDP) hearing conducted pursuant to section 6330(b) and (c).1  Appeals determined that respondent may proceed to collect by levy petitioner's  unpaid 2007 Federal income tax. We review Appeals' determination pursuant to  section 6330(d)(1). Petitioner assigns error to Appeals' determination on the  ground that Appeals abused its discretion in conditioning abandonment of the levy  on both an installment agreement, which petitioner would accept, and the filing of  a notice of tax lien (or, alternatively, petitioner's posting of a bond), which  petitioner would not accept.                                  FINDINGS OF FACT  Introduction        This case was submitted for decision without trial pursuant to Rule 122.  The parties have stipulated certain facts and the authenticity of certain documents.  The facts stipulated are so found, and the documents stipulated are accepted as  authentic. When he filed the petition, petitioner resided in Highland Park, Illinois.           1         Unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and in effect at all relevant times, and all Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure. We round all dollar amounts to the nearest dollar.                                           -4-  [*4] Petitioner's Income-Producing Activities        Petitioner is a sculptor who works in cast bronze and sells his artwork  through his wholly owned S corporation, Jim Budish Sculptor, Ltd. (Sculptor,  Ltd.), for which he is a salaried employee. Over the years, petitioner has relied on  a particular Arizona foundry (Metalphysic Sculpture Studio, Inc.) (foundry) to  provide the material he uses in his sculptures and to do the actual casting.  Typically, the sculptures are commissioned by the buyers who pay for them before  casting. Thus, petitioner does not maintain an inventory from which he regularly  sells his sculptures.  Petitioner's Tax Reporting for 2007        Petitioner filed his 2007 Federal income tax return (2007 return) late, on  October 21, 2008. On that return, he reported a tax liability of $164,928 and a  withholding credit of $1,000. He failed to remit the $163,928 balance due with his  return.  Respondent's Assessment and Collection Efforts        On November 17, 2008, respondent assessed the tax shown on the 2007  return, along with accrued interest and with additions to tax for petitioner's failures  (1) to timely pay tax and (2) to pay estimated income taxes. Respondent                                           -5-  [*5] immediately notified petitioner of the balance due. Petitioner has not paid  that balance.        On November 9, 2009, respondent notified petitioner of (1) his intent to  collect by levy petitioner's unpaid 2007 liability (then totaling $205,549) and (2)  petitioner's right to a pre-levy CDP hearing.  The CDP Hearing and Related Negotiations With Appeals        Petitioner timely requested the hearing. In the request, petitioner in essence  claimed that collection by levy was inappropriate since less intrusive methods of  collection, including an installment agreement, were available. Petitioner also  requested an abatement of the section 6651(a)(2) addition to tax on the ground that  \"'reasonable cause' exists for the taxpayer's failure to pay his taxes timely.\"        Petitioner's CDP hearing was conducted by an Appeals settlement officer  (Appeals officer). Petitioner was represented by his counsel, initially Garret M.  Francis, then Theodore H. Merriam (without distinction, counsel).        The Appeals officer met with counsel on April 27, 2011. Neither then nor  thereafter did petitioner challenge his underlying tax liability. Counsel asked for  an installment agreement to settle petitioner's 2007 liability, and, in connection  with that request, he advised the Appeals officer that an ongoing custody dispute  with the mother of petitioner's minor son had, thus far, cost petitioner over                                           -6-  [*6] $400,000 in legal fees and related costs and that petitioner was financially  responsible for the care of his mother, who required a full-time nurse. Counsel  and the Appeals officer reviewed the collection information that petitioner had  furnished to Appeals, which showed that petitioner had personal assets consisting  of $1,691 in cash, negative equity in his personal residence, an automobile worth  $4,000, and various personal assets worth $1,000. It also showed monthly income  of $19,816 and monthly living expenses of $21,785. They discussed the  possibility of an installment agreement, but the Appeals officer wanted additional  financial information and supporting documentation, which counsel provided to  her in mid-May.        One day after their meeting, counsel called the Appeals officer and offered  that petitioner would enter into an installment agreement obligating him to pay  $5,500 per month until his tax liability was discharged but on the condition that  respondent refrain from filing a notice of tax lien. The Appeals officer responded  that it was in the Government's best interest to file a notice of lien because  petitioner's tax liability exceeded $200,000.        In mid-May 2010, by letter to the Appeals officer, counsel argued that a  notice of lien would hamper rather than facilitate collection of petitioner's liability  by effectively putting him out of business, thereby terminating the flow of income                                           -7-  [*7] necessary to honor the installment agreement and, ultimately, to discharge  petitioner's outstanding liability. Specifically, counsel represented that, should  respondent file a notice of lien, petitioner's longstanding business relationship  with the foundry, from which he normally received 30%-50% discounts from  market pieces, would be drastically altered in that he would be required to  immediately pay for all work previously produced and make \"up front\" payments  for all future work. In that connection, counsel furnished a copy of a letter from  the foundry's president to petitioner, in which the former stated:        1.     [If] [f]or any reason payments due us are suspended or delayed,              production of your work will cease.        2.     For any further production to continue if this were to happen,              we would require any outstanding balances to be paid in full,              and also the full amount for any order that is placed with us.        3.     These conditions will remain in place until such time as we feel              comfortable that the situation has been resolved to our              satisfaction.        Counsel also represented that a notice of lien would cause the buyers of  petitioner's sculptures to cease financing petitioner by paying on a commission  basis (i.e., up front) for artwork they might never receive because of petitioner's  financial difficulties or because the artwork \"may be encumbered by either the tax  lien or other debtors [sic].\"                                           -8-  [*8] Finally, counsel represented that the lien notice would adversely affect  petitioner's ability to pay the foundry using his American Express credit card  because of the detrimental effect on his credit rating.        Notwithstanding counsel's argument against the filing of a notice of lien, the  Appeals officer, in August 2011, offered, as a collection alternative, \"to grant Mr.  Budish a $5,500 installment agreement\", but she conditioned that offer on the  filing of a lien notice. Because of her insistence on the lien notice, petitioner  rejected her offer (and, by implication, her earlier offer to accept a bond in lieu of  the lien notice filing). The Appeals officer then closed out her case and  recommended that Appeals sustain the proposed levy.  Notice and Attachment        On January 12, 2012, Appeals, in the person of Teresa Cismowski, Appeals  team manager, issued to petitioner a notice of determination (notice) sustaining the  proposed levy action. While the notice contains only a summary explanation of  Appeals' reasons for sustaining the levy (\"The Notice of Intent to Levy was issued  properly. Compliance is free to levy as they see fit.\"), Ms. Cismowski attached to  the notice the Appeals officer's recommendation, which apparently underlies  Appeals' determination. In a section of the attachment entitled \"Brief  Background\", the Appeals officer notes that, in response to petitioner's request that                                          -9-  [*9] no notice of lien be filed in conjunction with the agreed-upon installment  agreement, she \"advised * * * [petitioner's counsel] that * * * [she] was in  agreement with the installment agreement however the Taxpayer's balance due is  over $200,000 and the NFTL [notice of Federal tax lien] would be filed to protect  the government's interest.\" In a section entitled \"Discussion and Analysis\", under  the heading \"Collection Alternatives Offered by Taxpayer\", she concludes as  follows:        The Taxpayer requested an installment agreement instead of levy       action and also requested no NFTL be filed. IRM 5.14.1.4.2 requires       a lien filing determination be made prior to granting an installment       agreement. IRM 5.12.2.4 requires a[n] NFTL be filed if an       installment agreement does not meet streamlined, guaranteed, or in-       business trust fund express criteria. The Taxpayer's installment       agreement request does not meet these criteria; therefore the filing of       the NFTL would be required as a condition of the installment       agreement.        You have failed to show how withholding the lien filing would be in       the best interest of the government and facilitate collection.        I advised the POA I could accept the installment agreement but that       the NFTL would be filed as a condition of the installment agreement.       The POA refused to enter into the installment agreement and said he       would take the matter to tax court.",

Summary Opinion 2014-113                            UNITED STATES TAX COURT                 BABAK ROSHDIEH, M.D. CORP., Petitioner v.           COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Respondent          Docket No. 9907-13S L.                        Filed December 29, 2014.          Mike Austin (corporate officer), for petitioner.        Jeffrey Rice and Amy B. Ulmer, for respondent.                                  SUMMARY OPINION         ARMEN, Special Trial Judge: This case was heard pursuant to the  provisions of section 7463 of the Internal Revenue Code in effect when the                                           -2-  petition was filed.1 Pursuant to section 7463(b), the decision to be entered is not  reviewable by any other court, and this opinion shall not be treated as precedent  for any other case.        Pursuant to section 6330(d)(1), petitioner seeks review of the determination  by the IRS Office of Appeals that it is liable for a penalty under section 6699 for  failing to timely file a return under section 6037 for 2010. We sustain  respondent’s determination and hold that petitioner is so liable.                                      Background        Some of the facts have been stipulated, and they are so found. We  incorporate by reference the stipulated facts and the related exhibits.        Petitioner is a single-shareholder S corporation. When its petition was filed  with the Court, both its principal place of business and its principal office were in  the State of California.        As an S corporation petitioner is required to make an annual return pursuant  to section 6037.2 Petitioner’s returns for 2002 through 2012, specifically         1         Unless otherwise indicated, all subsequent section references are to the Internal Revenue Code (Code) in effect for 2010, the taxable year in issue. All Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure.       2        Subsec. (a) of sec. 6037, which is entitled “Return of S Corporation”, provides in part as follows:                                                                      (continued...)                                          -3-  including petitioner’s return for 2010, the taxable year in issue, were prepared by  Mike Austin, who also serves as petitioner’s corporate secretary and holds a power  of attorney from petitioner.3        Petitioner has a history of filing late the returns prescribed by section 6037.  For 2002 through 2012, specifically for 2010 as discussed below, petitioner did  not timely file those returns.4           2        (...continued)              SEC. 6037(a). In General.--Every S corporation shall make a       return for each taxable year, stating specifically the items of its gross       income and the deductions allowable by subtitle A, the names and       addresses of all persons owning stock in the corporation at any time       during the taxable year, the number of shares of stock owned by each       shareholder at all times during the taxable year, the amount of money       and other property distributed by the corporation during the taxable       year to each shareholder, the date of each such distribution, each       shareholder’s pro rata share of each item of the corporation for the       taxable year, and such other information, for the purpose of carrying       out the provisions of subchapter S of chapter 1, as the Secretary may       by forms and regulations prescribe. * * *       3          Mike Austin holds a bachelor’s degree from California State University at Fresno in business administration, management, and accounting. He is also the managing partner of Austin, Austin & Co., Inc., a California corporation that offers tax preparation services.       4          The record does not disclose whether petitioner timely filed its return for 2013. The transcript of account for 2013 is dated a few days before the extended due date for that return and hence does not reveal whether a return was timely filed for that year.                                            -4-        As a calendar year S corporation, petitioner’s return for 2010 was due on  March 15, 2011. See sec. 6072(b); sec. 1.6037-1(b), Income Tax Regs. At trial  Mr. Austin testified that on March 15, 2011, he mailed to respondent by regular,  first-class mail a Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File  Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns, for 2010. Mr.  Austin testified further that he rarely, if ever, used certified or registered mail. In  contrast, respondent’s official records do not reflect the receipt of any Form 7004  for 2010.5        On January 31, 2012, respondent received from petitioner by regular, first-  class mail a Form 1120S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation, for 2010,  which form constituted petitioner’s return pursuant to section 6037 for that year.6        On the basis of petitioner’s failure to timely file a return for 2010,  respondent assessed a penalty under section 6699 of $2,145 and sent petitioner a  notice of balance due on March 12, 2012. See secs. 6303, 6699(c) and (d).         5         Certified transcripts of petitioner’s accounts for 2002 through 2013 show that respondent received Forms 7004 for only 6 of those 12 tax years despite the fact that petitioner never filed its return for any of those years by the statutory due date.       6         The record does not include the envelope in which the return was mailed, so the postmark date that may have appeared on the envelope is not known. At trial Mr. Austin testified that the return was mailed on or about October 15, 2011, but he introduced no documentary evidence in support of his testimony.                                           -5-        Petitioner did not pay the outstanding liability. Accordingly, after issuing  several preliminary collection notices, respondent sent to petitioner on July 17,  2012, a Final Notice Of Intent To Levy And Notice Of Your Right To A Hearing.  In response, petitioner timely mailed a Form 12153, Request For A Collection Due  Process Or Equivalent Hearing.        Respondent received petitioner’s request and forwarded the case to the IRS  Office of Appeals. After some preliminary correspondence between the parties,  including a letter from Mr. Austin arguing that petitioner could not have a liability  because it was an S corporation that paid at the individual level, the settlement  officer conducted an administrative hearing on December 14, 2012. At the  hearing the parties discussed the underlying liability, with the settlement officer  explaining that it arose from the late filing of petitioner’s Form 1120S for 2010.        On January 3, 2013, the settlement officer received a letter from Mr. Austin  regarding petitioner’s position on the late-filing penalty and enclosing, inter alia,  an undated Form 7004. On February 26, 2013, the settlement officer left a  voicemail message for Mr. Austin explaining that the late-filing penalty was  calculated at a rate of $195 per shareholder per month and proposing, apparently  for settlement purposes, a partial abatement of the late-filing penalty.                                           -6-        On March 1, 2013, the settlement officer and Mr. Austin held another  conference. As in a prior communication, the settlement officer again explained  that the late-filing penalty was calculated at a rate of $195 per shareholder per  month. Shortly thereafter, the settlement officer received a letter from Mr. Austin  dated March 2, 2013, acknowledging the prior day’s telephone conference and  stating that petitioner disagreed with the determination to only reduce (and not  eliminate) the late-filing penalty for 2010. Mr. Austin also expressly  acknowledged in his letter how the late-filing penalty was calculated: “$195 × 1  person × 11 months ' $2145.”7        On March 13, 2013, the settlement officer received another letter from Mr.  Austin again rejecting the settlement officer’s offer to partially abate the late-filing  penalty.        On April 3, 2013, after the settlement officer had verified that the  requirements of applicable law and administrative procedure were satisfied,  respondent sent petitioner a notice of determination sustaining the proposed           7         At some point during the administrative process, Mr. Austin was either provided with a copy of, or his attention was directed to, highlighted portions of the official instructions for Form 1120S for 2010 regarding “[l]ate filing of return” and stating in pertinent part that “[f]or returns on which no tax is due, the penalty is $195 for each month or part of a month (up to 12 months) the return is late”.                                            -7-  collection action.8 The notice of determination discussed petitioner’s failure to  timely file a Form 1120S for 2010 and explained that the late-filing penalty was  calculated at a rate of $195 per shareholder per month.        Petitioner timely filed a petition commencing the instant case, alleging  therein that it is not liable for any late-filing penalty under section 6699. At trial,  however, petitioner took the position that it timely requested a six-month  extension of the March 15, 2011, due date to September 15, 2011, and filed its  2010 Form 1120S on October 15, 2011, and is therefore liable for a penalty of  $195 on the basis of a filing delinquency of one month.                                        Discussion        In a collection review hearing a taxpayer is entitled to challenge the liability  sought to be collected if the taxpayer did not have a prior opportunity to do so.  Sec. 6330(c)(2)(B). Petitioner’s argument that it is not liable for the late-filing  penalty is a challenge to the underlying liability respondent seeks to collect. See  Callahan v. Commissioner, 130 T.C. 44, 49 (2008). Petitioner did not previously         8         The notice of determination is a bit ambiguous in that it concludes that “[t]he proposed levy is appropriate, and Collections may proceed with enforced collection action” in respect of the outstanding assessment (i.e., $2,145, plus accruals), but the notice then goes on to “recommend” that the penalty be partially abated (by $537), apparently consistent with the settlement officer’s aforementioned settlement offer of February 26, 2013.
