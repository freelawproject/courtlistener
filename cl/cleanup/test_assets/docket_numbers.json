COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE,                                                                RESPONDENT                                                    Docket No. 4775–11.                         Filed August 9, 2012.                                                 P timely filed his 2008 Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income                                               Tax Return, after previously filing a Form 1040–ES, Esti-                                               mated Tax, and paying $4,000 in estimated taxes. On his                                               Form 1040, P mistakenly added the $4,000 estimated tax pay-                                               ment to the income tax withheld reported on line 62 instead                                               of the estimated tax payments reported on line 63. That mis-                                               take contributed to R’s issuance of a refund to P on May 11,                                               2009. R later realized that P had reported the $4,000 esti-                                               mated tax payment on line 62, and R subsequently informed                                               P that he owed $4,000 plus a penalty and interest. P filed a                                               request for abatement, and R granted P’s request to abate the                                               penalty but denied P’s request to abate the interest. Held:                                               Even though the refund was recoverable by assessment and                                               levy procedures, the refund also would have been recoverable                                               by filing a civil suit pursuant to I",
