Filed June 12, 2017.\nAlan David Snow, pro se.\nRic D. Hulshoff and John C. Nash, for respondent.\nSUMMARY OPINION\nGOEKE, Judge: This case was heard pursuant to the provisions of section\n74631 of the Internal Revenue    T.C. Summary Opinion 2017-38 Code in effect when the petition was filed.\n1\nAll section references are to the Internal Revenue Code in effect at all\nrelevant times, and all Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of\nPractice and Procedure, unless otherwise indicated.\n-2-\nPursuant to section 7463(b), the decision to be entered is not reviewable by any\nother court, and this opinion shall not be treated as precedent for any other case.\nAlan Snow originally petitioned for review of a determination by the\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) Appeals Office (Appeals) in Seattle, Washington,\nto sustain the filing of a notice of Federal tax lien (NFTL) and a proposed levy to\ncollect his unpaid income tax liability for 2013. He no longer disputes the\ndetermination regarding the NFTL but maintains that an installment agreement\nproposal should have been accepted in lieu of the levy. After the Court granted\nthe parties’ joint motion to submit the case under Rule 122, Dr. Snow alleged, in\nvarious submissions, that a series of changed circumstances had occurred after the\nadministrative process was completed. We have considered these submissions and\nDr. Snow’s initial arguments, and for the reasons explained herein we sustain\nAppeals’ determination.\nBackground\nAt the time he filed the petition, Dr. Snow resided in Washington State.\nDr. Snow was sent a Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your\nRight to a Hearing on January 27, 2015, regarding tax owed for 2013. A notice of\nNFTL filing dated February 12, 2015, followed. He timely requested a collection\n-3-\ndue process hearing (CDP hearing) on February 20, 2015, and a series of letters\nfrom Appeals to him followed.\nOn March 25, 2015, Steve Fuqua and Joe Mastriano (representatives)\nsubmitted by facsimile a Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of\nRepresentative, authorizing them to represent Dr. Snow in the hearing before\nAppeals and for other tax years as well. Dr. Snow simultaneously requested that\nthe proposed CDP hearing be deferred until May 11, 2015. A settlement officer\n(SO) replied in a facsimile the next day, stating as follows:\nI am in receipt of your fax dated 3/25/2015 asking for an extension to\n5/11/2015 for the Appeals hearing for taxpayer A. Snow. That is not\ngoing to be granted unless your client can show that he is in\ncompliance with all of his current tax obligations. My letter dated\n3/16/15 asks for his 2014 tax liability and proof of payment. I see\nthat an extension to file is on the records, but that is just an extension\nto file, and he is required to pay the liability by then either with\ncorrect withholding or by making estimated tax payments. Your\nclient has a long history of not timely meeting his tax obligations, and\nthis must stop before he is considered for another installment\nagreement. He was also requested to provide a financial statement\nand copies of personal bank statements. All of this information is due\nto be provided by 3/30/2015. If the information is not provided, then\nthe hearing will be held as scheduled and a decision made on\navailable information. If ALL of the information requested is\nprovided, then I will agree to re-schedule the meeting to either date of\n4/20/15, or 4/24/15.\nOn March 31, 2015, the SO sent another facsimile to the representatives, stating in\npart as follows:\n-4-\nRe: Dr Snow- I have reviewed the IRM regarding your request for a\ntransfer to Houston for the Face to face hearing & I must deny your\nrequest * * *\n*          *           *           *           *           *             *\nTreas. Reg. 301.6330-1(e) states, “Taxpayers will be expected to\nprovide all relevant information requested by Appeals, including\nfinancial statements, for its consideration of the facts and issues\ninvolved in the hearing.” Treas. Reg. 301.6330-1 Q&A-D8 further\nstates, “A face-to-face CDP conference concerning a collection\nalternative, such as an installment agreement or an offer to\ncompromise liability, will not be granted unless other taxpayers\nwould be eligible for the alternative in similar circumstances.”\nEligibility requirements are those threshold conditions that must be\nmet in order for Appeals to consider the taxpayer’s proposed\nalternative to collection. The regulations give the filing of required\nreturns and making certain required deposits of tax as examples of\neligibility requirements.\nMr. Fuqua then sought appeal of the decision not to transfer the case, but\nthe SO replied as follows:\nRe: A Snow. There is no appealing the decision not to transfer the\ncase to Houston. The IRM is clear that if a case meets requirements\nfor transfer for a face to face meeting, it will be sent to the Appeals\noffice closest to the taxpayer’s residence or business location. Also,\nthe taxpayer must show that he is eligible to be considered for a\ncollection alternative before a face to face hearing is granted. An\nextension to provide such information for Appeals consideration was\ngranted until 4/6/2015. If all of the requested information is not\nprovided, then our decision will be based on available information. It\nmay be necessary to have Compliance investigate & verify\ninformation provided before a final decision is made. Appeals will\nmaintain jurisdiction and the taxpayer will be given an opportunity to\n-5-\nrespond to their findings before we determine the resolution. Please\ncall if there are any questions.\nMr. Fuqua sent a facsimile on April 8, 2015, stating that Dr. Snow would\npay down his 2013 tax liability to under $50,000 and requested an installment\nagreement with a monthly payment of $1,000. In a letter dated April 9, 2015, the\nSO stated:\nIRM 5.14.1.2(8)f addresses compliance issues before an installment\nagreement will be approved: it states “current returns for taxes must\nbe filed and current deposits paid before an installment agreement can\nbe approved and the taxpayer must remain tax compliant for the entire\nterm of the installment agreement, or he/she will default the\nagreement” My appointment letter asked for you to provide your\nestimated tax liability and proof of payment. This has not been\nprovided. I am giving you one final opportunity to show that you are\nin compliance with your tax compliance obligations. If the\ninformation is not provided as requested, then your agreement will\nnot be approved and the case will be returned to Compliance for\nresolution. Your extension for 2014 is for filing only- you are\nrequired either to have had sufficient tax withholding or paid your\nestimated tax payments. The 2014 W2 information shows your\nincome was $522,550.00 and withholding of $48,000.00. Please call\nif there are any questions.\nDr. Snow then sent a letter to the SO stating his intent to pay off his tax year\n2013 liability and requesting an installment agreement. Included in the letter was\na check for $25,000 for purposes of paying down Dr. Snow’s tax year 2013\nliability to under $50,000. The letter, however, made no mention of his tax year\n2014 liability.\n-6-\nOn April 23, 2015, the SO sent a letter to Dr. Snow through the\nrepresentatives stating in part:\nAppeals had a telephone hearing with your representatives Steve\nFuqua and Joe Mastriano on Tuesday 4/21/2015 to discuss your\nsituation. You do not qualify for a installment agreement under\n“fresh start” criteria because this is not the first time that you have\nincurred a tax liability. I told your reps that I would be willing to\nconsider an installment agreement only after you provide your 2014\nestimated tax liability so it may be included in an installment\nagreement as a “pre-assessed” period or proof that you have paid it\nalong with providing proof that you have increased your withholding\nfor 2015 and if necessary, proof of your 2015 estimated tax payment\nthat was due by 4/15/2015. Your 2014 extension is for “FILING”\nonly- Qualifying for the Extension\nTo get the extra time you must:\n1. Properly estimate your 2014 tax liability using the information\navailable to you,\n2. Enter your total tax liability on line 4 of Form 4868, and\n3. File Form 4868 by the regular due date of your return.\nOn May 7, 2015, one of the representatives left a message with the SO\nstating that Dr. Snow did not have the information requested and was expecting a\nnotice of determination. The SO issued a notice of determination on May 15,\n2015, and Dr. Snow timely petitioned this Court for review of the determination.\nDiscussion\nSection 6330 provides a procedural framework for review of proposed\ncollection actions during an administrative hearing, as explained more fully in\nGoza v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 176 (2000). Section 6330(d)(1) grants this Court\n-7-\njurisdiction to review the determination by Appeals. Section 6330(c)(2)(B)\npermits a taxpayer to challenge the underlying liability in a collection due process\nproceeding under limited circumstances, but Dr. Snow has not challenged the\n2013 tax liability. Rather, he focuses his arguments on the SO’s decision to deny\nhis proposed installment agreement. The law is well established that in such\nsituations we review the SO’s determination for abuse of discretion. Sego v.\nCommissioner, 114 T.C. 604, 609 (2000).\nRespondent maintains that the SO followed the procedures prescribed in the\nInternal Revenue Manual. In response, Dr. Snow asserts he does not know what\ntranspired with the SO because he had engaged representatives for the CDP\nhearing. He offers no statement from his prior counsel nor any rebuttal to\nrespondent’s position as to what actually transpired regarding the SO’s\nconsideration of the proposed installment agreement. We see no basis to presume\nthe SO’s representation of the circumstances is not accurate, and we note that the\ncorrespondence in the record supports respondent’s position.\nOn the basis of the communication between the SO and the representatives,\nwe find no abuse of discretion in this case. Dr. Snow’s proposed installment\nagreement was not accepted because he had underpaid his 2014 tax liability. See\nBoulware v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2014-80, at *21 (“We have consistently\n-8-\nheld that an Appeals officer does not abuse his discretion in denying a taxpayer’s\nrequest for an installment agreement when the taxpayer is not in compliance with\nhis current tax obligations as of the date of the CDP hearing.”). Accordingly, we\n",
