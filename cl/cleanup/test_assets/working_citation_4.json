Memo. 2001-287\nUNITED STATES TAX COURT\nLEE NELSON SHAW, Applicant v.\nCOMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Respondent\nVIRGINIA MARIE SWEENEY, Applicant v.\nCOMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Respondent\nDocket Nos. 1-01-D, 2-01-D.             Filed October 29, 2001.\nKenneth M. Hart, for applicants.\nWilliam A. Heard III, for respondent.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nDAWSON, Judge:   These consolidated cases were assigned to\nChief Special Trial Judge Peter J. Panuthos pursuant to Rules 180\nand 181 and Interim Rule 183.1     The Court agrees with and adopts\n1\nUnless otherwise indicated, all section references are to\nthe Internal Revenue Code in effect for the years in issue, and\n(continued...)\n- 2 -\nthe opinion of the Chief Special Trial Judge, which is set forth\nbelow.\nOPINION OF THE SPECIAL TRIAL JUDGE\nPANUTHOS, Chief Special Trial Judge:    These matters are\nbefore the Court on Lee Nelson Shaw’s (Mr. Shaw) and Virginia\nMarie Sweeney’s (Mrs. Sweeney) separate applications to\nperpetuate testimony, filed pursuant to Rule 82.    (For\nconvenience, we will refer to Mr. Shaw and Mrs. Sweeney,\ncollectively, as the applicants.)    The applicants do not have\ncurrent petitions for redetermination of deficiencies before the\nCourt.\nBackground\nThe applicants are siblings.    Mr. Shaw and Mrs. Sweeney were\n71 and 78 years of age, respectively, at the time the\napplications herein were made.    At the time of filing the\napplications, Mr. Shaw resided at Vero Beach, Florida, and Mrs.\nSweeney resided at Chappaqua, New York.\nThe applications in these cases state that, in 1951, the\napplicants, along with their brother, Robert S. Shaw (now\ndeceased), each formed separate trusts.    The trusts named City\nBank Farmers Trust Co. (now Citibank) and Marie A. Shaw, the\napplicants’ mother, as trustees.    The applications further state:\n1\n(...continued)\nall Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and\nProcedure.\n- 3 -\n(1) The applicants formed the trusts at the direction of their\nfather, Leo N. Shaw; (2) the applicants’ parents funded the\ntrusts over a 12-year period either by transferring assets\ndirectly to the trusts or by transferring assets to the\napplicants, who in turn transferred the assets to the trusts; and\n(3) the applicants’ mother generally converted income from the\ntrusts to household use.   Although the applicants were named as\nbeneficiaries of their respective trusts, income from the trusts\nwas not made available to the applicants until after their\nparents died.\nMr. Shaw’s trust currently holds assets valued at\napproximately $5.8 million, and Mrs. Sweeney’s trust currently\nholds assets valued at approximately $4.2 million.    The\napplicants both have substantial assets in addition to their\ntrusts.\nThe applicants assert that the value of their respective\ntrusts should not be included in their gross estates for purposes\nof computing Federal estate taxes.     In particular, the applicants\nmaintain that their parents funded the trusts and the applicants\nwere merely “nominal settlors” with a life estate in the trusts.\nThe applicants are concerned that, after their deaths, respondent\nwill examine their estates’ Federal estate tax returns and\ndetermine that the value of the trusts should be included\n- 4 -\ntherein.2   The applicants further anticipate that their personal\nrepresentatives will contest respondent’s determinations by\nfiling a petition with the Court.    The applicants contend that\nthey are the only living persons with knowledge of the\ncircumstances underlying the creation, funding, and\nadministration of the trusts.\nRespondent filed a response in opposition to the\napplications, arguing in part:    (1) The applicants have failed to\nshow that they expect to be parties to a case cognizable in this\nCourt; and (2) the applicants have failed to show that there is a\nsignificant risk that the desired testimony will be lost before\ntrial because (a) there is no evidence that either applicant is\nsuffering from any serious illness, and (b) it is likely that one\nof the applicants will be available to testify at a Tax Court\ntrial concerning the estate of the first to die.\nThis matter was called for hearing at the Court’s motions\nsession in Washington, D.C.    Counsel for the parties appeared at\nthe hearing and offered argument.\nDiscussion\nRule 82 provides for the taking of depositions before the\n2\nAlthough the applicants state that they became aware of\nthe trust issue following their brother’s death, there is no\nallegation that respondent issued a notice of deficiency to the\nEstate of Robert S. Shaw.\n- 5 -\ncommencement of a Tax Court case “to perpetuate testimony or to\npreserve any document or thing regarding any matter that may be\ncognizable in this Court”.   Rule 82 is derived from rule 27(a) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and we are guided by\njudicial interpretations of rule 27 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure in the absence of our own precedent.   Reed v.\nCommissioner, 90 T.C. 698, 700 (1988).\nRule 82 states that an application must include:   (1) The\nfacts showing that the applicant expects to be a party to a case\ncognizable in this Court but is at present unable to bring it or\ncause it to be brought; (2) the subject matter of the expected\naction and the applicant’s interest therein; and (3) all matters\nrequired to be shown in an application under paragraph (b)(1) of\nRule 81 except item (H) thereof.   Rule 81(b)(1), as is relevant\nhere, requires the applicant to show the reason for deposing a\nperson rather than waiting to call the person as a witness at\ntrial and the substance of the testimony that the applicant\nexpects to elicit.   Rule 82 further provides:\nIf the Court is satisfied that the perpetuation of the\ntestimony or the preservation of the document or thing\nmay prevent a failure or delay of justice, then it will\nmake an order authorizing the deposition and including\nsuch other terms and conditions as it may deem\nappropriate consistently with these Rules. * * *\nThe instant applications state that the applicants expect\nthat, after the death of each, their respective estates will be\nparties to cases cognizable in this Court and that the cases will\n- 6 -\nconcern the question whether the values of their trusts should be\nincluded in their gross estates for purposes of computing Federal\nestate taxes.   As indicated, respondent objects to the\napplications.\nIt is our view that Rule 82 was not intended to be invoked\nunder the abstract circumstances of these cases.   The facts here\nare clearly distinguishable from those in GlaxoSmithKline\nHoldings (Americas) Inc. v. Commissioner, 117 T.C. 1 (2001).     In\nGlaxoSmithKline Holdings, the examination of the taxpayer was\nongoing.   Attempts were made to resolve differences through the\nAdvance Pricing Agreement Program and through the Internal\nRevenue Service’s Office of Appeals.   The taxpayer further\nrequested relief from double taxation under the so-called\ncompetent authority process.   At the time of making the\napplication to perpetuate testimony, the taxpayer anticipated\nthat the competent authority process could be protracted and that\nit would be 4 or 5 years before the case might proceed to trial.\n",
