COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE,                                                            RESPONDENT                                                         Docket No. 14572–07L.                 Filed January 11, 2010.                                                    P wife signed a Form 900, Tax Collection Waiver, con-                                                taining a waiver extending the 10-year period of limitations                                                on collection for the first 4 of the tax years in issue. After                                                signing the waiver, Ps entered into an installment agreement                                                with R. Although P husband’s signature purportedly appears                                                on the Form 900, P husband contends that he never signed                                                the Form 900 and, therefore, the waiver is invalid as to both                                                Ps. R contends that P husband signed the waiver and that,                                                if P husband did not sign the waiver, the waiver is neverthe-                                                less valid as to both Ps. Ps also contend that R failed to send                                                Ps a notice of deficiency for the tax years in issue. Held: Adler                                                v. Commissioner, 85 T.C. 535 (1985), which delineates the                                                parties’ respective burdens of production and proof regarding                                                the 3-year period of limitations on assessment under sec.                                                6501(c)(4), I.R.C., also applies to cases involving the 10-year                                                period of limitations on collection under sec. 6502(a)(1), I.R.C.                                                Held, further, P wife may separately enter into a valid waiver                                                of the 10-year period of limitations on collection for tax years                                                for which she has filed a joint tax return, and the waiver is                                                valid as to her. The waiver, however, is not valid as to P hus-                                                band unless he also signed the Form 900 or unless he may not                                                otherwise repudiate it. Held, further, because the waiver of                                                the 10-year period of limitations on collection is a dispute                                                regarding the underlying liability, we review de novo the                                                issue of whether P husband’s signature on the Form 900 is                                                authentic. Held, further, Ps did not meet their burden of                                                                                                                                        1     VerDate 0ct 09 2002   11:09 May 14, 2013   Jkt 372897    PO 20009   Frm 00001   Fmt 2847   Sfmt 2847   V:\\FILES\\JORDAN.TES   SHEILA                                      2                  134 UNITED STATES TAX COURT REPORTS                                         (1)                                                proving that P husband did not sign the Form 900.

Petitioners are husband and wife. Petitioners filed joint                                       Federal income tax returns for the tax years in issue.
