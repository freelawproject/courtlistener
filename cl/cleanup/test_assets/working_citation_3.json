Summary Opinion 2015-45\nUNITED STATES TAX COURT\nMINNIE MAE HOWELL, Petitioner v.\nCOMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Respondent\nDocket No. 19556-14S L.                       Filed August 6, 2015.\nMinnie Mae Howell, pro se.\nAndrew J. Davis, for respondent.\nSUMMARY OPINION\nTHORNTON, Chief Judge: This case was heard pursuant to the provisions\nof section 7463 of the Internal Revenue Code in effect when the petition was\nfiled.1 Pursuant to section 7463(b), the decision to be entered is not reviewable by\n1\nAll other section references are to the Internal Revenue Code in effect at all\nrelevant times. Some monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest dollar.\n-2-\nany other court, and this opinion shall not be treated as precedent for any other\ncase. The issue for decision is whether respondent erred in sustaining a proposed\nlevy with respect to petitioner’s 2004 Federal income tax.\nBackground\nAfter examining petitioner’s 2004 Federal income tax return, respondent\nissued her a notice of deficiency determining a $10,439 deficiency and a $2,088\nsection 6662(a) accuracy-related penalty. In response, petitioner timely petitioned\nthis Court. On October 22, 2008, pursuant to the parties’ stipulation, the Court\nentered a decision in her case at docket No. 23887-06 that for 2004 petitioner had\na deficiency of $6,250 and no section 6662(a) accuracy-related penalty. On\nFebruary 9, 2009, respondent assessed the $6,250 deficiency as well as $1,801 of\nstatutory interest. He later assessed a section 6651(a)(2) addition to tax for failure\nto timely pay.\nOn April 24, 2009, respondent and petitioner entered into an installment\nagreement with respect to her 2004 tax liability. Petitioner made several payments\nunder the installment agreement but none after August 31, 2013. Respondent\nrevoked the installment agreement on December 16, 2013.\nOn January 13, 2014, respondent sent petitioner a CP 90, Final Notice--\nNotice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Right to a Hearing, with respect to her\n-3-\n2004 tax liability. On February 12, 2014, respondent received from petitioner a\nForm 12153, Request for a Collection Due Process or Equivalent Hearing. On the\nForm 12153 petitioner contended that her 2004 tax liability had been paid, that the\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) had incorrectly assessed penalties and interest, and\nthat the IRS had failed to process her “first payment”. Petitioner did not propose a\ncollection alternative.\nPetitioner’s case was assigned to an Appeals settlement officer (SO). On\nApril 30, 2014, the SO mailed petitioner a letter scheduling her collection due\nprocess (CDP) hearing and requesting additional information regarding her “first\npayment”, which she did not provide. On June 3, 2014, the SO telephoned\npetitioner to conduct the hearing and to reiterate his request for additional\ninformation. During the hearing petitioner told the SO that in 2009 she had\nendorsed a third-party workers’ compensation check from the U.S. Department of\nLabor (USDOL) for $2,789.90 and mailed it to the IRS to satisfy her 2004 tax\nliability.\nPetitioner faxed the SO a copy of a letter dated April 7, 2014, that she had\nreceived from the USDOL. The letter indicated that the USDOL had issued\npetitioner a workers’ compensation check for $2,789.90 between July 6 and\nAugust 2, 2008, that the check had never been cashed, and that it would be\n-4-\nreissued to her. Petitioner also sent the SO a certified mail receipt, which showed,\naccording to petitioner, that she had mailed the $2,789.90 workers’ compensation\ncheck to the IRS on May 11, 2009.\nIn a telephone call on June 13, 2014, the SO suggested to petitioner that she\nshould deposit the reissued workers’ compensation check into her bank account,\nsubmit payment to the IRS for the unpaid balance on her 2004 tax liability, and\nfile a Form 843, Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement, requesting that the\ncurrent payment be applied as of the date in 2009 when petitioner allegedly sent\nthe IRS the original workers’ compensation check. That same day, the SO mailed\npetitioner a blank Form 843 with instructions. In a followup phone call on July 3,\n2014, petitioner confirmed with the SO that she had received the Form 843 but\nstated that she did not plan on making any additional payment because she felt that\nshe had already overpaid her 2004 tax. The record does not show that petitioner\never submitted to the IRS a Form 843 or any additional information.\nOn July 16, 2014, respondent sent petitioner a Notice of Determination\nConcerning Collection Action(s) Under Section 6320 and/or 6330. The notice of\ndetermination sustained the proposed levy because petitioner failed to make a\npayment to replace the workers’ compensation check she purportedly sent to the\nIRS in May 2009. It also indicated that petitioner’s interest abatement claim was\n-5-\ndenied because she failed to file a Form 843 as directed. While residing in North\nCarolina, petitioner timely petitioned this Court for review of this determination.\nDiscussion\nSection 6331(a) provides that if any person liable to pay any tax neglects or\n",
