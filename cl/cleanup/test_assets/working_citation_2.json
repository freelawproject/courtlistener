Filed May 6, 2013.\nP was divorced from his wife, and their 2003 ‘‘Judgment of\nAbsolute Divorce’’ provided that his ex-wife would have pri-\nmary residential custody of their three minor children. The\njudgment provided that the dependency exemption deductions\nfor the three children would be divided between the two ex-\nspouses according to various conditions but did not provide\nthat the ex-wife must execute in P’s favor a Form 8332,\n‘‘Release of Claim to Exemption for Child of Divorced or Sepa-\nrated Parents’’. The children resided with P’s ex-wife for more\nthan half of 2009, and P’s ex-wife did not execute in P’s favor\nany Form 8332 or equivalent document for any year. For 2009\nP timely filed a Federal income tax return on which he\nclaimed dependency exemption deductions and the child tax\ncredit for two of the children, consistent with his under-\nstanding of the terms of the judgment, but he did not attach\nany Form 8332 to his return. He also claimed head-of-house-\nhold filing status.

COMMISSIONER                                        201\nclaimed two dependency exemption deductions, so that one\nchild was claimed on both parents’ returns. R allowed to P the\ndependency exemption deduction for one of the children but\ndisallowed his claim for the dependency exemption deduction\nfor the child who had also been claimed by the custodial\nparent. At trial P contended he is entitled to a dependency\nexemption deduction for all three children. Held: Since the\ncustodial parent did not execute, and P could not and did not\nattach to his return, any Form 8332 or equivalent release, P\nis not entitled under I.R.C. sec. 152(e)(2)(A) to claim the\ndependency exemption deduction or the child tax credit. Held,\nfurther, where both the custodial parent and the noncustodial\nparent have claimed for the same year a dependency exemp-\ntion deduction for the same child, a declaration signed by the\ncustodial parent after the period of limitations for assess-\nments has expired as to the custodial parent could not qualify\nunder I.R.C. sec. 152(e)(2)(A), and therefore there is no reason\nto grant P’s request to leave the record open so that he may\nobtain and proffer such a declaration. Held, further, P is not\nentitled to head-of-household filing status under I.R.C. sec.\n2(b)(1) nor to the child tax credit under I.R.C. sec. 24.\nMichael Keith Shenk, for himself.\nShari Salu, for respondent.\nGUSTAFSON, Judge: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\ndetermined a deficiency of $3,136 in the 2009 Federal income\ntax of petitioner Michael Keith Shenk. Mr. Shenk petitioned\nthis Court, pursuant to section 6213(a), 1 for redetermination\nof the deficiency. After Mr. Shenk’s concession that he\nreceived but did not report $254 in dividend income, the\nissue for decision is whether Mr. Shenk is entitled to a\ndependency exemption deduction for one of his children\nunder section 151(c), a child tax credit for that child under\nsection 24(a), and head-of-household filing status under sec-\ntion 2(b)(1). On these issues, we hold for the IRS.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe judgment of divorce\nMr. Shenk was married to Julie Phillips, and they have\nthree minor children—M.S., W.S., and L.S.
