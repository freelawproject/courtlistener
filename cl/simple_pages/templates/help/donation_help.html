    <h2>Recurring Donations</h2>
    <h3>When are recurring donations charged?</h3>
    <p>Recurring donations are charged monthly on the day that you set up your original monthly contribution. If that day is on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of the month, we will charge you on the 28th of each month instead.
    </p>

    <h3>What if the credit card I'm using for monthly donations is stolen or expires?</h3>
    <p>For American credit cards, our credit card processor is usually able to handle these issues seamlessly. If not, we'll send you an email when your card fails.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I cancel or pause a monthly donation?</h3>
    <p>If you set up the monthly donation while logged into your CourtListener account, you will be able to <a href="{% url "profile_donations" %}">see and cancel it via your profile</a>. If not, we will be happy to help you cancel or pause the donation if you <a href="{% url "contact" %}">send us a brief note</a>.

    <h3>How do I update my credit card information or use a different card?</h3>
