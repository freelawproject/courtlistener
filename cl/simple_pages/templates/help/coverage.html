    <h1>Data Coverage &mdash; What's in CourtListener?</h1>
    <p class="lead">CourtListener is a vast searchable collection of legal information.</p>
    <p>We have millions of judicial opinions including <a href="https://free.law/projects/supreme-court-data/">a detailed collection of SCOTUS opinions</a>, we have tens of millions of PACER docket entries in the <a href="{% url "advanced_r" %}">RECAP Archive</a>, and we have <a href="{% url "advanced_oa" %}">the largest collection of oral argument recordings</a> available on the Internet, with {{ oa_duration|intcomma }} minutes of recordings (and counting).
    </p>
    <p>The best way to think about our data is to consider where we get it from. The answer to that question depends on which kind of information you are interested in &mdash; PACER data (the RECAP Archive), opinions, or oral argument recordings.
    </p>


    <hr>
    <h2 id="recap-archive">PACER Data (The RECAP Archive)</h2>
    <p>Broadly speaking, the <a href="{% url "advanced_r" %}">RECAP Archive</a> consists of dockets, docket entries, documents, parties, and attorneys. Our goal with the RECAP Archive is to collect any PACER data that we can so that we can share it as widely as possible.
    </p>
    <p>This content is sourced in a variety of ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>RECAP Extensions:</strong> One of the most important sources of PACER data are the <a href="https://free.law/recap/">RECAP Extensions</a>. The RECAP Extensions are simple tools for Firefox, Chrome and Safari that send us copies of documents and dockets that you purchase on PACER, as you use PACER. Since 2009, users of the RECAP extensions have contributed millions of documents from PACER to the RECAP Archive.
        </p>
        <p>RECAP is used by many journalists, and as a result, these documents tend to be some of the most newsworthy in the country. If you use PACER, <a href="https://free.law/recap/">install the RECAP Extension</a> to save money and contribute to the RECAP Archive.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>@recap.email system:</strong> People that receive notification emails from PACER can use the <a href="{% url "recap_email_help" %}">@recap.email system</a> to add documents to the RECAP Archive. Each time they get a notification from PACER, we get it too, and we use it to add content to the RECAP Archive.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Special Case Scrapers:</strong> Special cases get additional monitoring via a system of scrapers that regularly gathers data from PACER. Examples of "special" cases are those that have active <a href="{% url "alert_help" %}#recap-alerts">RECAP Alerts for PACER</a>, are saved in <a href="{% url "tag_notes_help" %}#notes">notes</a>, or are otherwise popular or important.
      </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Our PACER Scraping Tools:</strong> We host <a href="https://free.law/2019/11/05/pacer-fetch-api/">free APIs that many organizations use to gather cases and documents from PACER</a>. Every day, many organizations rely on these automated tools to add innumerable cases and documents to our system.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Client Work:</strong> One way <a href="https://free.law">Free Law Project</a>, the non-profit sponsoring CourtListener and RECAP, remains sustainable is by doing bulk PACER downloads for organizations. In these arrangements, <a href="https://free.law/data-consulting/">we work with clients</a> to purchase thousands of dollars worth of PACER content, all of which we add to the RECAP Archive.
        </p>
        <p>Aside from the client engagements noted below, we cannot share the details of client engagements:</p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Broad Data</strong> — In early 2023, we added short descriptions and basic metadata for about 150M documents in the PACER system. This data was drawn from over three million PACER RSS feeds gathered and contributed by <a href="https://www.trollerbk.com/">Troller BK</a> in support of our mission.</li>
            <li><strong>Broad Data</strong> — In early 2021, we scraped basic metadata from every unsealed bankruptcy, civil, and criminal case in the PACER system. This data, gathered on behalf of a major media organization, spans about 60M cases, and includes the case name, date filed, date terminated, and judge.</li>
            <li><strong>Broad Data</strong> — In May 2019, we downloaded nearly all civil district court dockets filed in from January 1, 2016 to November 9, 2018. Dockets with natures of suit related to civil rights, prisoner petitions or patent law were excluded.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bankruptcy Data</strong> — In 2020, we worked with a researcher to gather $1.9M worth of content from the Southern District of Illinois Bankruptcy Court. For every case from 2007 to 2017, we downloaded the docket sheet, initial petition, and docket entries containing the word "final."
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fair Labor Standards Act Data (FLSA)</strong> — We worked with a start-up to create an extensive collection of labor-related dockets and initial complaints. The date range for this collection is from 2009 to 2017.</li>
            <li><strong>Export Control</strong> — We have a large, random sample of dockets related to export-controlled technology collected on behalf of a major DoD policy oragnization.</li>
            <li><strong>Invoices</strong> — We have a large collection of documents described by the word "invoice" that can be used for machine learning.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, we have some data sources that we have not yet merged into CourtListener. These can be treasure troves of data and are detailed on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/freelawproject/projects/16">our project board dedicated to the topic</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>PACER Judicial Opinion Scraper:</strong> When clerks upload documents to PACER, they must consider <a href="https://free.law/pacer-facts/#written-opinions-are-free-on-pacer-but-h">whether
        those documents are official opinions or orders of the court</a>. If they are, the clerks are supposed to mark them as such, and those documents become free to download from PACER. Each night <a href="https://free.law/2017/08/15/we-have-all-free-pacer/">we download all documents that clerks mark in this way</a> from district and bankruptcy courts across the country.
      </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>PACER RSS Feeds:</strong> Most of federal district courts  provide RSS feeds listing their latest docket entries. We crawl these feeds on an ongoing basis to get the latest docket entries. This amounts to around 100,000 docket entries per day that we add to the RECAP Archive. Unfortunately, this only adds docket entries, not documents, party, or attorney information. For details on which courts are supported by RSS <a href="{% url "alert_help" %}#coverage-gaps">see the documentation on alerts</a>.
      </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Social Media Bots:</strong> We host <a href="https://bots.law">a fleet of social media bots</a> that download important documents from PACER so they can be shared with the public. The bots use <a href="{% url "api_index" %}">CourtListener APIs</a> to download content from PACER. As a result, anything the bots buy is automatically contributed to the RECAP Archive.
      </p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The above sources account for a vast quantity and an ongoing supply of PACER information. There's no quick answer to "What's in RECAP?", but we hope that the above provides a working framework. Of course, if something is not in RECAP and you wish it were, you can always add it by using the RECAP Extensions. We hope you will.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h2 id="adding-updating">Adding or Updating PACER Data in Our System</h2>
    <p>It is cost-prohibitive for us to have every court document or case. If you wish to add something to our collection, the best way is to install the RECAP extension and purchase the item yourself on PACER.
    </p>
    <hr>



    <h2 id="opinions">Judicial Opinions</h2>
    <p>Our database of opinions was created over a span of many years and was acquired from a variety of sources. We do not currently claim to have complete coverage of judicial opinions, but we believe that we will one day soon. Once we have this data collected, it will not be necessary to collect it again.
    </p>
    <p>Our judicial opinions database has a variety of sources which we merge together to create the most complete collection possible:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Bulk contributions:</strong> Long before we began our work, Carl Malamud at <a href="https://public.resource.org/">Public.Resource.Org</a> was way ahead of us. When we started, one of our first steps was to add the data that he had collected, including the the complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports">United States Reports</a> going back to 1759, <a href="https://free.law/2011/08/25/second-series-of-federal-reporter-from-1950-to-1993-now-on-courtlistener/">the second series of the Federal Reporter</a>, and <a href="https://free.law/2012/05/13/announcing-the-third-series-of-the-federal-reporter/">volumes 1-491 of the third series of the Federal Reporter</a>. These sources added {{ count_pro|intcomma }} opinions to our collection.
        </p>
        <p>In 2013 we <a href="https://free.law/2013/10/30/lawbox/">received a generous data donation from Lawbox, LLC</a> that contributed to {{ count_lawbox|intcomma }} opinions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Scrapers:</strong> Since 2010, we have gathered opinions directly from court websites via <a href="https://free.law/juriscraper/">our Juriscraper toolkit</a>. When we began, we only collected content from the federal Circuit courts and the Supreme Court, but as of now we run over 200 scrapers throughout every day. So far, they have contributed to {{ count_scraper|intcomma }} opinions. The supported courts <a href="#scraped-jurisdictions">are listed below</a>.
      </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Supreme Court Database (SCDB):</strong> The <a href="http://scdb.wustl.edu/">NSF-funded SCDB</a> is the gold standard for high-quality legal information, and we have <a href="https://free.law/2014/12/21/scdb/">linked it up with the data available in the United States Reports</a>. Doing this added parallel citations and other metadata to tens of thousands of SCOTUS opinions.
      </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Library of Congress:</strong> The Library of Congress released a PDF listing the filing dates for thousands of early historical Supreme Court cases. We have <a href="https://free.law/2011/05/25/updated-scotus-dates/">integrated these dates</a> so our users have the best information possible.
      </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We currently have one more source of judicial opinions that we plan to add to the above sources. When that is complete, we will perform an audit to ensure that every opinion from both WestLaw and LexisNexis are readily available to the public in high-quality, machine readable, and easily accessible formats. <a href="{% url "contact" %}">Get in touch</a> if you want to help support this historical project.
    </p>
    <p>We welcome additional data donations on our <a href="{% url "donate" %}?referrer=coverage">donate</a> page of any public domain legal data.
    </p>

    <h3 id="opinion-chart">Seeing Our Opinion Coverage</h3>
    <p>The chart below attempts to demonstrate the number of opinions we have in each jurisdiction in any given year. A few notes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the drop down to select a court to inspect.</li>
      <li>Bars can be clicked to view the opinions from that year.</li>
      <li>Counts below include both <a href="{% url "faq" %}#non-precedential">precendential and non-precedential</a> opinions.
      </li>
      <li>The large spike you may see in the Supreme Court in the early 2000's is due to denied
        certiorari's being included in the reporters during those years. This is not a data error.
      </li>
    </ol>
