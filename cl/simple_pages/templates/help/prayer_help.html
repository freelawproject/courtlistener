  <h1 id="about">Help with Pray and Pay&nbsp;Project</h1>
  <p class="lead">Since 2009, CourtListener has helped people keep up with new cases and legal topics.</p>
  <p>The Pray and Pay Project is a system so you can "Pray" for PACER documents you want, and others can grant those prayers by "Paying" for them on your behalf.</p>

  <h2 id="pray-and-pay">Pray and Pay Project</h2>
  <p>PACER is the largest paywall on the internet with around a half-million new documents filed weekly.
  </p>
  <p>To advance our mission of open access to the courts, this system allows you to request documents you want on PACER (by "praying" for them), and to fulfill the prayers of others by buying the most-wanted documents in the community.
  </p>
  <p class="alert alert-warning"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> <strong>Listen Up:</strong> PACER waives the first $30.00 of purchases you make each quarter. By sending reminder emails near the end of each quarter, we encourage users to use this money to contribute the documents other users need.
  </p>
  <p>Since the project's creation, users have fulfilled <span class="bold">{{ granted_stats.prayer_count|intcomma }}</span> prayers for <span class="bold">{{ granted_stats.distinct_count|intcomma }}</span> documents, for a total contribution of <span class="bold">${{ granted_stats.total_cost }}</span>!
  </p>


  <h3 id="fulfilling-prayer">Fulfilling a Prayer</h3>
  <p>The most-wanted documents are shown on a <a href="{% url "top_prayers" %}">leaderboard</a> ranked by how many users have requested a particular document and how old the requests are. As requests are fulfilled, they are removed from the leaderboard.
  </p>
  <p>Fulfilling somebody's prayer only works if you install the RECAP extension. Once it's installed, all your PACER purchases will be sent to CourtListener automatically ‚Äî Prayers will be granted!</p>

    <a href="{% url "top_prayers" %}"
       class="btn btn-primary"> See the Leaderboard</a>
  </p>

  <h3 id="creating-prayer">Creating a Prayer</h3>
  <p>To create a Prayer, find a document you are interested in, and press the "Prayer Hands" emoji button on the right (üôè). The number on the button is how many others have requested the document. If you have reached your daily limit, a message will inform you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{% static "png/pray-button.png" %}"
      alt="screenshot of the prayer button"
      class="img-responsive img-rounded shadow center-block"
      width="45">
  </p>
  <p>When your prayer is granted, we will send you an email so you know.
  </p>
  <p>Here's an example of what an email might look like:</p>
  <p class="v-offset-above-2">
    <a href="{% static "png/alert-example.png" %}">
      <img src="{% static "png/prayer-email.png" %}"
           width="749"
           height="529"
           class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block shadow"
      >
    </a>
  </p>
  <p class="v-offset-below-2 gray alt small">
    (Click for full size version.)
  </p>

  <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
  <p>Each user can place <span class="bold">{{ daily_quota }}</span> prayers per day. This prevents people from praying for every item on the site.
  </p>

  <h3 id="deleting-prayer">Deleting a Prayer</h3>
  <p>To delete a Prayer, navigate to a docket you have previously requested a document from, and press the üôè button on the right again. Alternatively, you can navigate to the {% if user.is_authenticated %}<a href="{% url 'user_prayers' user.username %}">list of prayers in your profile</a>{% else %}list of prayers in your profile{% endif %} and delete from there. It is not possible to delete a prayer once it is fulfilled.
  </p>

  <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
  <p>We do not currently support requests to purchase docket information such as attorneys, parties, or docket text such as minute orders, but we hope to support that in the future.
  </p>
  <p>We also hope to allow users (such as freelance journalists) to create public wishlists of documents to share with others.
  </p>
  <p>Please stay tuned!</p>
