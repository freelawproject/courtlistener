    <h1>Help with @recap.email</h1>
    <p class="lead"><strong>@recap.email</strong> is a system that gathers content from PACER and adds it to the <a href="{% url 'advanced_r' %}">RECAP Archive</a>. If you receive notification emails from PACER, it only takes a minute to set up this system and contribute content to the public commons.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Three easy steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Every party in a case gets notification emails that contain one-time "magic links." These links give free access to new filings in the case.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We give you an email address that you can configure in your PACER account as a secondary recipient for these notifications. Your primary address in PACER is never changed.</p>
        <p class="alert-warning alert">
          {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
            Your @recap.email email address is <b>{{ request.user.profile.recap_email }}</b>
          {% else %}
            Log in and refresh this page to see your personal @recap.email address here.
          {% endif %}
        <p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After you add us as a secondary recipient in PACER, we'll get a copy of your notification emails. When we do, we'll automatically add the items to RECAP.
        </p>
        <p>If you have <a href="{% url "view_recap_email" %}">auto-subscribe turned on in your profile</a> (the default), we will automatically start sending you email notifications for the case. If auto-subscribe is off, we will send you one email for each case you're associated with in PACER, when we get the first notification for that case from PACER. In the email we send, you can click a link to subscribe to it on CourtListener so you get all of its notifications, or if you do nothing, you won't get more emails for that case.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's it!</p>

    <h2>Why is this useful to me?</h2>
    <p>If you begin using @recap.email, you get some nice benefits immediately:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>You can feel good about contributing to the public commons.</p></li>
      <li><p>You can forget about the emails you currently get from PACER. Just route them to a folder in case you need them someday and that's a wrap.</p></li>
      <li><p>Every time there's a notification in one of your cases, we'll send you an email with the document linked.</p></li>
      <li><p>All of the notification emails we send you will have a link to the docket in RECAP, where all of the documents you've contributed will be full-text searchable.</p></li>
      <li><p>It almost goes without saying, but when you use @recap.email, you save yourself from ever paying to download a document in your cases. Your PACER bill get smaller.</p></li>
      <li><p>No more one-time links and download hassles. Unlike PACER notifications, our emails can be freely shared. Forward them to colleagues and clients as you see fit.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why is this useful to the public?</h2>
    <p>Because of high PACER fees, researchers, journalists, and individuals do not have access to legal information the way they should. This means that researchers cannot study the federal judiciary the way it merits, investigative reports fail to launch or are hamstrung by bad data, and the public struggles to access the real information in the courts.</p>
    <p>When you use @recap.email, these problems get better as new filings in your cases are automatically added to RECAP. This makes those filings available to the public via our website, and allows us to build better datasets for researchers and journalists. </p>
    <p>Over time, as more people use @recap.email, it makes the case to Congress and the judicial branch that these documents should be public and that, given a choice, people believe in the importance of court transparency.</p>


    <h2>What's "The Funnel"?</h2>
    <p>The funnel is a way that you can send us your notification emails without even having a CourtListener account. To use The Funnel, add <code>funnel@recap.email</code> as a secondary recipient in your CM/ECF account. Once added, we'll process your notification emails in realtime, without linking them to any CourtListener account, sending you emails, etc.
    </p>
    <p>The next time you search for your case on CourtListener, you'll discover it's all there.</p>


    <h2>How is this useful to my firm? Webhooks.</h2>
    <p>By default, we will send you notification emails when we get an email from PACER on your behalf. For firms we offer something even better. Instead of sending an email to a user, we can send an event to a webhook the firm has configured.</p>
    <p>This allows our servers to tell yours that something new has arrived in one of your firm's cases. From there, the sky's the limit. Using the message we send you, your servers can download the document and put it in your knowledge management system. Your servers can send notifications to the lead attorney for the case or to the appropriate paralegal. </p>
    <p>Whatever workflow you have in mind can be arranged. The event is no longer in some inbox — Instead it's going directly to your server.</p>
    <p>To get started with webhooks, <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">please get in touch</a>. We'll schedule a meeting to go over the details.</p>


    <h2>How do I set it up?</h2>
    <p>Set up takes a few minutes. You just have to add a secondary email address to your PACER account.</p>
    <p class="alert-warning alert">
      {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
        Your @recap.email email address is <b>{{ request.user.profile.recap_email }}</b>
      {% else %}
        Log in and refresh this page to see your personal @recap.email address here.
      {% endif %}
    <p>
    <p>To add a secondary email address to your PACER account, you can follow the steps in the <a
        href="https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/sites/dcd/files/2016_Utilities_Menu.pdf#page=4" rel="nofollow">ECF User's
        Manual</a>, but the gist is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Log into PACER's user management portal here:</p><p><a href="https://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/pscof/login.xhtml" rel="nofollow">https://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/pscof/login.xhtml</a></p></li>
      <li><p>Select <b>Maintain Your Email</b> and then <b>Add New Email Address.</b></p></li>
      <li><p>Enter
          {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
            <b>{{ request.user.profile.recap_email }} </b>
          {% else %}
            your @recap.email address
          {% endif %}
          as a secondary email address, and make sure that it's set to receive HTML notifications for all your cases.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>After you add us as a secondary recipient in PACER, we'll get a copy of your notification emails. When we do, we'll add the items to RECAP and we'll send you a notification so you know we did.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Done!</p>

    <h2>What about my privacy?</h2>
    <p>We keep copies of the emails we receive so that we can use them to fix problems in the system, but we do not share those emails. Beyond that, we take pains to never publicly tie your username or identity to content that you've contributed to RECAP.</p>
    <p>You can read more about this in <a href="https://free.law/recap/privacy-policy/">RECAP's privacy policy</a>.</p>


    <h2>What about sealed content?</h2>
    <p>We take sealed content very seriously and have designed the system to never add sealed content to RECAP. Instead, when we encounter sealed content, we will send you a notification of that fact and include the one-time “magic link” in our email for you to click yourself.</p>

    <h2>What about accidents?</h2>
    <p>Sometimes filers don't redact things properly. Sometimes content becomes sealed after it has been published on PACER. It happens more than it should. If anything like this happens, we work quickly to make it right. Usually that just means taking the item out of our systems as quickly as possible and marking the entry as sealed.</p>

    <h2>More questions?</h2>
    <p>Please get in touch if you have more questions. We know this is an ambitious and complicated product and we welcome your feedback and concerns. Please feel free to reach out and let us know what you think.</p>
