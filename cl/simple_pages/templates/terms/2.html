        <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>

        <p>CourtListener does not buy, sell, or share your data in any way. We
            do not allow any form of third-party tracking, and instead use the
            open source <a href="http://piwik.com">Piwik web analytics tool</a>
            to collect information about site traffic and usage.</p>

        <p>We temporarily collect the following standard technical information
            about our visitors in our logs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The website that referred you to our site (via the <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referrer">HTTP
                Referer</a> field)
            </li>
            <li>The browser software you use and the plugins it supports, your
                operating system, and your monitor's resolution
            </li>
            <li>What country you are from, and what network provider you use.
                In the case of some very large organizations, this may mean
                that we may know that a visitor from your organization visited
                our site.
            </li>
            <li>The first nine digits of the Internet protocol (IP) address of
                the computer you are using or network you are on. The last four
                digits are removed to increase your anonymity.
            </li>
            <li>Any queries that you made in our search, alert or Atom feeds
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The information we collect is kept primarily to assist us in
            diagnosing technical problems and defending against attacks on the
            site, and we delete our logs automatically every 12 weeks.</p>

        <p>We do not collect personal information about our visitors unless
            they register an account. We will store account information unless
            you ask us to delete your account or delete it yourself.</p>

        <p>We do not yet support the emerging Do Not Track header standard.</p>

        <p>Please contact us if you have any complaints or concerns about our
            privacy policy, or notify the FTC via their <a
                    href="http://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov">online
                Complaint Assistant</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="removal">Removal policy</h2>

        <p>CourtListener believes that there is a compelling public interest in
            making the law broadly available to all, and that is why we have
            poured our energies into making the best free legal research tool
            that we can. We recognize however, that there are occasionally
            competing privacy interests of individuals and organizations. This
            policy describes the balance that we attempt to strike when
            thinking about this conflict of interests, and describes our policy
            for accepting and working with removal requests.</p>

        <p>If you would like a case removed from the results of the major
            search engines, please send us a written request to the address on
            the <a href="/contact">contact page</a>. Upon receiving this
            request, we will generally block search engines from finding pages
            on our site by including an entry in our <a href="/robots.txt">robots.txt
                file</a>, but we willl not remove any public document from our
            database without a court order. If you want information deleted
            from our site, your only recourse is to get it deleted from the
            public record by contacting the courts that issued the opinion, or
            to otherwise obtain a court order. In such a case, you should
            likely contact the court directly.</p>

        <p>After we have included your case on our robots.txt file, the blocked
            pages will eventually be removed from all search engines, however,
            as is mentioned above, your case is a public document, and there
            may be other copies of it on the Internet &ndash; Although
            <em>we</em> will have blocked the search engines from finding your
            case, there may be other websites that have copies of it. In
            addition, we have no control over any search engine, and they may
            not remove your case from their results for many months, if at all.
        </p>

        <p>If, after reading the above, you would still like to have a case
            listed in our robots.txt file so it is not found by search engines,
            please send your written request to the address on our contact
            page. You may also attempt to contact us via email, but we do not
            guarantee receipt of email communications.</p>

        <p>We might change this policy in the future and make no guarantees
            that we will keep our robots.txt file in place. Further, all
            removals are at our sole discretion.</p>

        <p>This policy is very similar to the policies of other major sources
            of free online court opinions, and we hope that we have struck a
            reasonable balance between both your interests and the public's
            interest in your case.</p>
