      <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>CourtListener does not sell information collected about your visits to this site or usage of this site and will only share such information in the ways explained in this policy. We have never used third party tracking. From 2009 to 2022 we self-hosted the Matomo analytics system so that our user's traffic would not be shared with third parties. In March of 2022, we went further, and stopped tracking users across sites or even pages by switching to <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible Analytics</a>.
      </p>

      <p>We do not track you across pages or visits, but we do use <a href="https://plausible.io" target="_blank">Plausible Analytics</a> to collect some information from your computer, and we do log visits. These systems help us identify popular pages, diagnose technical problems, and defend our initiatives against attacks. For example, we collect the following technical information about our visitors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The website that referred you to our site (via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referrer">HTTP Referer</a> field)
        </li>
        <li>The browser software you use, your operating system, and your monitor's resolution
        </li>
        <li>What country you are from
        </li>
        <li>Any queries that you made in our search, alert or Atom feeds
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Where possible, we delete usage-related logs automatically when they are 12 weeks old. We may share anonymized information collected with academic researchers, and they may publish their research based on that information.
      </p>

      <p>We do not collect personal information about our visitors unless they register an account. We will store account information unless you ask us to delete your account or delete it yourself.
      </p>


      <p>We currently share data with the following third parties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>We use Amazon, Inc.'s AWS services to store and process data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For the purpose of sending newsletters, we share information with <a href="https://moosend.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Moosend, Ltd, a subsidiary of Sitecore, Inc</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For the purpose of processing transactions, we share information with <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stripe, Inc.</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PayPal, Inc</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For the purpose of error tracking, we share error and logging information with <a href="https://sentry.com" target="_blank">Sentry, Inc</a>. This information generally does not contain any PII and is purged after 90 days.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For the purpose of counting page visits, we use <a href="https://plausible.io" target="_blank">Plausible Analytics</a>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please contact us if you have any complaints or concerns about our privacy policy, or notify the FTC via their <a href="http://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov">online Complaint Assistant</a>.

    <div id="removal">
      <h3>Removal Policy</h3>
      <p>The Board of Directors of <a href="https://free.law/">Free Law Project</a>, the non-profit sponsoring CourtListener, believes that there is a compelling public interest in making the law broadly available to all. In pursuit of this goal, we have poured our energies into making CourtListener.com the best free legal research tool that we can. Occasionally however, there can be competing privacy interests of individuals and organizations. This policy describes the balance that we attempt to strike when thinking about this conflict of interests, and describes our policy for accepting and working with removal requests.
      </p>

      <p>If you would like a case removed from the results of the major search engines, please <a href="{% url "contact" %}">send us a request using the contact page</a>. You must include links to the pages you would like removed. Upon receiving this request, we will generally block search engines from indexing pages on our site by using the robots HTML meta tag and/or the x-robots-tag HTTP header.
      </p>

      <p>We will not remove any public document from our database without a court order. If you want information deleted from our site, your only recourse is to get it deleted from the public record and to obtain a court order demanding that we do the same. If you are able to furnish such a court order, we will generally remove the document from our site. If the court order demands an expungement or redaction, we will generally anonymize or redact cases by replacing names with initials or black boxes, and placing a note at the top of the document explaining the change. We will not make changes to any other documents without a court order that specifically requires that we do so.
      </p>

      <p>After we have blocked the pages, they will eventually be removed from all search engines, however, as is mentioned above, your case is a public document, and there may be other copies of it on the Internet &ndash; Although <em>we</em> will have blocked the search engines from finding your case, there may be other websites that have copies of it. In addition, we have no control over any search engine, and they may not remove your case from their results for many months, if at all.
      </p>

      <p>If, after reading the above, you would still like to have a case blocked, so it is not found by search engines, please send your written request as described above. You may also attempt to contact us via email, but we do not guarantee receipt of email communications.
      </p>

      <p>Placing court documents online is a form of First Amendment expression that is protected by numerous state and federal statutes. Despite this, we have occasionally been sued for doing so. It is against <a href="https://free.law/mission">our mission</a> to lose such a case and we never have. We have even fought back against unconstitutional judicial orders <a href="https://free.law/2020/12/30/victory-for-public-access-to-court-documents/">and won</a>. If you are considering suing us over content on our website, we strongly urge you to instead wait until the search engines have removed the content from their results.
      </p>

      <p>We might change this policy in the future and make no guarantees that we will keep blocked records in place. Further, all removals not pursuant to a court order are at our sole discretion.
      </p>

      <p>This policy is similar to the policies of other major sources of free online court opinions, and we hope that we have struck a reasonable balance between both your interests and the public's interest in your case.

      <h3>Copyright Policy</h3>

      <p>CourtListener.com follows the notice and takedown procedures in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512">17 U.S.C. Section 512</a>.
      </p>

      <p>If you believe content on CourtListener.com violates your copyright, please immediately notify its operators by sending a message with the information described below through the <a href="{% url "contact" %}">contact page</a>. Please use the subject "Copyright" in your message. If CourtListener.com's operators act in response to an infringement notice, they will make a good-faith attempt to contact the person who contributed the content using the most recent email address that person provided to CourtListener.com.
      </p>

      <p>Under the DMCA, you may be held liable for damages based on material misrepresentations in your infringement notice. You must also make a good-faith evaluation of whether the use of your content is a fair use, because fair uses are not infringing. See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">17 U.S.C. Section 107</a> and <a href="{% url "view_case" "2937139" "stephanie-lenz-v-universal-music-corp" %}"><em>Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.</em>, No. 13-16106 (9th Cir. Sep. 14, 2015)</a>. If you are not sure if the content you want to report infringes your copyright, you should first contact a lawyer.
      </p>

      <p>The DMCA requires that all infringement notices must include <strong>all</strong> of the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf
        </li>
        <li>An identification of the copyright claimed to have been infringed
        </li>
        <li>A description of the nature and location of the material that you claim to infringe your copyright, in sufficient detail to allow CourtListener.com to find and positively identify that material</li>
        <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address
        </li>
        <li>A statement that you believe in good faith that the use of the material that you claim to infringe your copyright is not authorized by law, or by the copyright owner or such owner's agent
        </li>
        <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in your infringement notice is accurate
        </li>
        <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are either the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>CourtListener.com will respond to all DMCA-compliant infringement notices, including, as required or appropriate, by removing the offending material or disabling all links to it.
      </p>

      <p>All received infringement notices may be posted in full to the <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/">Lumen database</a> (previously known as the Chilling Effects Clearinghouse).
