      <h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>

      <p>CourtListener does not sell information collected about your visits
          to this site and will only share such information in the ways
          explained in this policy. We do not allow any form of third-party
          tracking, and instead use the open source <a
                  href="http://piwik.com">Piwik web analytics tool</a> to
          collect information about site traffic and usage.</p>

      <p>We temporarily collect the following standard technical information
          about our visitors in our logs:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The website that referred you to our site (via the <a
                  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referrer">HTTP
              Referer</a> field)
          </li>
          <li>The browser software you use and the plugins it supports, your
              operating system, and your monitor's resolution
          </li>
          <li>What country you are from, and what network provider you use.
              In the case of some very large organizations, this may mean
              that we may know that a visitor from your organization visited
              our site.
          </li>
          <li>The first nine digits of the Internet protocol (IP) address of
              the computer you are using or network you are on. The last four
              digits are removed to increase your anonymity.
          </li>
          <li>Any queries that you made in our search, alert or Atom feeds
          </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The information we collect is kept primarily to assist us in
          diagnosing technical problems and defending against attacks on the
          site, and we delete our logs automatically every 12 weeks. We may
          use the information collected to change the site, by, for
          example,studying user queries to try to improve the quality of
          search results.We may also share anonymized information collected
          with academic researchers and they may publish their research based
          on that information.</p>

      <p>We do not collect personal information about our visitors unless
          they register an account. We will store account information unless
          you ask us to delete your account or delete it yourself.</p>

      <p>We support the <a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a>
          standard through the Piwik DoNotTrack plugin.</p>

      <p>Please contact us if you have any complaints or concerns about our
          privacy policy, or notify the FTC via their <a
                  href="http://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov">online

      <h3 id="removal">Removal Policy</h3>

      <p>The Board of Directors of <a href="https://free.law/">Free Law Project</a>, the non-profit sponsoring CourtListener, believes that there is a compelling public interest in making the law broadly available to all. In pursuit of this goal, we have poured our energies into making CourtListener.com the best free legal research tool that we can. Occasionally however, there can be competing privacy interests of individuals and organizations. This policy describes the balance that we attempt to strike when thinking about this conflict of interests, and describes our policy for accepting and working with removal requests.
      </p>

      <p>If you would like a case removed from the results of the major search engines, please <a href="{% url "contact" %}">send us a request using the contact page</a>. You must include links to the pages you would like removed. Upon receiving this request, we will generally block search engines from indexing pages on our site by using the robots HTML meta tag and/or the x-robots-tag HTTP header.
      </p>

      <p>We will not remove any public document from our database without a court order. If you want information deleted from our site, your only recourse is to get it deleted from the public record and to obtain a court order demanding that we do the same. If you are able to furnish such a court order, we will remove the document from our site. If the court order demands an expungement or redaction, we will typically anonymize or redact cases by replacing names with initials or black boxes, and placing a note at the top of the document explaining the change. We will not make changes to any other documents without a court order that specifically requires that we do so.
      </p>

      <p>After we have blocked the pages, they will eventually be removed from all search engines, however, as is mentioned above, your case is a public document, and there may be other copies of it on the Internet &ndash; Although <em>we</em> will have blocked the search engines from finding your case, there may be other websites that have copies of it. In addition, we have no control over any search engine, and they may not remove your case from their results for many months, if at all.
      </p>

      <p>If, after reading the above, you would still like to have a case blocked, so it is not found by search engines, please send your written request as described above. You may also attempt to contact us via email, but we do not guarantee receipt of email communications.
      </p>

      <p>We might change this policy in the future and make no guarantees that we will keep blocked records in place. Further, all removals not pursuant to a court order are at our sole discretion.
      </p>

      <p>This policy is similar to the policies of other major sources of free online court opinions, and we hope that we have struck a reasonable balance between both your interests and the public's interest in your case.

      <h3 id="copyright">Copyright Policy</h3>

      <p>CourtListener.com follows the notice and takedown procedures in the
          Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), <a
              href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512">17 U.S.C.
          Section 512</a>.</p>

      <p>If you believe content on CourtListener.com violates your copyright,
          please immediately notify its operators by sending a message with
          the information described below through the <a
                  href="{% url "contact" %}">contact page</a>. Please use the
          subject "Copyright" in your message. If CourtListener.com's
          operators act in response to an infringement notice, they will make
          a good-faith attempt to contact the person who contributed the
          content using the most recent email address that person provided to
          CourtListener.com.</p>

      <p>Under the DMCA, you may be held liable for damages based on
          material misrepresentations in your infringement notice. You must
          also make a good-faith evaluation of whether the use of your
          content is a fair use, because fair uses are not infringing. See
          <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">17 U.S.C.
          Section 107</a> and <a

          <em>Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.</em>, No. 13-16106 (9th Cir. Sep.
          14, 2015)</a>. If you are not sure if the content you want to
          report infringes your copyright, you should first contact a
          lawyer.</p>

      <p>The DMCA requires that all infringement notices must include
          <strong>all</strong> of the following:</p>

      <ol>
          <li>A signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to
              act on the copyright owner's behalf</li>
          <li>An identification of the copyright claimed to have been
              infringed</li>
          <li>A description of the nature and location of the material that
              you claim to infringe your copyright, in sufficient detail to
              allow CourtListener.com to find and positively identify that
              material</li>
          <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address</li>
          <li>A statement that you believe in good faith that the use of the
              material that you claim to infringe your copyright is not
              authorized by law, or by the copyright owner or such owner's
              agent</li>
          <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that all of the
              information contained in your infringement notice is
              accurate</li>
          <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are either the
              copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their
              behalf.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>CourtListener.com will respond to all DMCA-compliant infringement
          notices, including, as required or appropriate, by removing the
          offending material or disabling all links to it.</p>

      <p>All received infringement notices may be posted in full to the
          <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/">Lumen database</a> (previously
          known as the Chilling Effects Clearinghouse).</p>
