    <h1>Data Coverage &mdash; What Financial Disclosures Do We&nbsp;Have?</h1>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2010-title5/pdf/USCODE-2010-title5-app-ethicsing.pdf"> Ethics in Government Act of 1978</a> requires that senior government officials file annual disclosures listing their personal financial interests. In the Judicial Branch, this law applies to certain judicial employees and all judges. Once filed, these disclosures are generally available to the public for six years. After that time has elapsed the statute generally <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5a/compiledact-95-521/title-I/section-105">requires that disclosures be "destroyed."</a>
    </p>
    <p>Historically, these disclosures were not collected systematically because it was too difficult to do so. Each disclosure had to be requested individually by fax, and had to be paid for by check. A big change to this policy came in the <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2017-03_0.pdf#page=12">March, 2017 meeting of the Judicial Conference</a>, where they created a new policy that allowed the disclosures to be released on "electronic storage devices…at no cost to the requestor."
    </p>
    <p>This was a monumental change in policy, and since that time, <strong>Free Law Project has requested all of the disclosures that are legally available</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>At this time, we have received over <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeLawProject/status/1301921783151341568">a dozen thumb drives from the Financial Disclosures Office</a>.

    <p><a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/" rel="nofollow">One other organization</a> has systematically placed disclosures online, and we have gathered their corpus as well, as described below. A news organization called ABPNews also gathered them in the late nineties, but after going out of business in 2000, <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeLawProject/status/1093612415185350656">their records were lost to water damage</a>.

    <p class="small gray">* Differences in these columns are due to disclosures frequently being broken into multiple files.

    <p>If you know of other disclosures not already in our collection, we would <a href="{% url "contact" %}">love to hear from you</a>. We need your help to complete this collection.</p>

    <h2 id="enhancements">Our Enhancements</h2>
    <p>We have dedicated considerable energy to develop <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/disclosure-extractor">a parsing system</a> for these disclosures. This system takes the disclosure file, whether it’s a tiff or pdf, scanned or text, or collection of tiffs and converts it into machine-readable JSON data. When we first ran this system, it took weeks for our servers to parse the information from the disclosures.</p>
    <p>Once the parsing was completed, we ingested it into our database, where it is <a href="{%  url "api_index" %}">available via our APIs and website</a>. As of this moment, there are <strong>{{ disclosures|intcomma }}</strong> disclosures documenting::
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>{{ investments|intcomma }}</strong> Investments</li>
      <li><strong>{{ positions|intcomma }}</strong> positions held outside of the judiciary</li>
      <li><strong>{{ agreements|intcomma }}</strong> Legal agreements</li>
      <li><strong>{{ non_investment_income|intcomma }}</strong> Sources of non-invetsement income</li>
      <li><strong>{{ spousal_income|intcomma }}</strong> Sources of spousal income</li>
      <li><strong>{{ reimbursements|intcomma }}</strong> Reimbursements</li>
      <li><strong>{{ gifts|intcomma }}</strong> Gifts to judges and judicial employees</li>
      <li><strong>{{ debts|intcomma }}</strong> Debts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When combined with our detailed database of judges, this creates a one-of-a-kind resource for understanding the conflicts, resources, and entanglements of federal judges. We believe this brings our country closer to finally realizing the goals set out by the 1978 Ethics in Government Act.
