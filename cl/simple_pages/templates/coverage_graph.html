    <h1>Data Coverage &mdash; What's in CourtListener?</h1>
    <p>CourtListener is a vast searchable collection of legal information. We have millions of judicial opinions including <a href="https://free.law/supreme-court-data/">a detailed collection of SCOTUS opinions</a>, we have tens of millions of PACER docket entries in the <a href="{% url "advanced_r" %}">RECAP Archive</a>, and we have <a href="{% url "advanced_oa" %}">the largest collection of oral argument recordings</a> available on the Internet, with {{ oa_duration|intcomma }} minutes of recordings (and counting).
    </p>
    <p>The best way to think about our data is to consider where we get it from. The answer to that question depends on which kind of information you are interested in &mdash; PACER data (the RECAP Archive), opinions, or oral argument recordings. Read on to learn more or skip ahead to the section that interests you:

    <h2 id="recap-archive" class="v-offset-above-3">PACER Data (The RECAP Archive)</h2>
    <p>Broadly speaking, the <a href="{% url "advanced_r" %}">RECAP Archive</a> consists of dockets, docket entries, documents, parties, and attorneys. Our goal with the RECAP Archive is to collect any PACER data that we can so that we can share it as widely as possible.
    </p>
    <p>This content is sourced in a variety of ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>RECAP Extensions:</strong> One of the most important sources of PACER data are the <a href="https://free.law/recap/">RECAP Extensions</a>. The RECAP Extensions are simple tools for Firefox and Chrome that send us copies of documents and dockets that you purchase on PACER, as you use PACER. Since 2009, users of the RECAP extensions have contributed millions of documents from PACER to the RECAP Archive.
        </p>
        <p>RECAP is used by many journalists, and as a result, these documents tend to be some of the most newsworthy in the country. If you use PACER, <a href="https://free.law/recap/">install the RECAP Extension</a> to save money and contribute to the RECAP Archive.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>PACER Judicial Opinion Scraper:</strong> When clerks upload documents to PACER, they must consider <a href="https://free.law/pacer-facts/#written-opinions-are">whether
        those documents are official opinions or orders of the court</a>. If they are, the clerks are supposed to mark them as such, and those documents become free to download from PACER. Each night <a href="https://free.law/2017/08/15/we-have-every-free-pacer-opinion-on-courtlistenercom/">we download all documents that clerks mark in this way</a> from district and bankruptcy courts across the country.
      </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Client Work:</strong> One way <a href="https://free.law">Free Law Project</a>, the non-profit sponsoring CourtListener and RECAP, remains sustainable is by working with organizations of all kinds to do bulk PACER downloads. In these arrangements, <a href="https://free.law/data-consulting/">we work with clients</a> to purchase thousands of dollars worth of PACER content, all of which we add to the RECAP Archive.
      </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>PACER RSS Feeds:</strong> Most of the PACER courts provide RSS feeds listing their latest docket entries. We crawl these feeds on an ongoing basis to get the latest docket entries. This amounts to around 100,000 docket entries per day that we add to the RECAP Archive. Unfortunately, this only adds docket entries, not documents, party, or attorney information.
      </p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The above sources account for a vast quantity and an ongoing supply of PACER information. There's no quick answer to "What's in RECAP?", but we hope that the above provides a working framework. Of course, if something is not in RECAP and you wish it were, you can always add it by using the RECAP Extensions. We hope you will.

    <h2 class="v-offset-above-3" id="opinions">Judicial Opinions</h2>
    <p>Our database of opinions was created over a span of many years and was acquired from a variety of sources. We do not currently claim to have complete coverage of judicial opinions, but we believe that we will one day soon. Once we have this data collected, it will not be necessary to collect it again.
    </p>
    <p>Our judicial opinions database has a variety of sources which we merge together to create the most complete collection possible:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Bulk contributions:</strong> Long before we began our work, Carl Malamud at <a href="https://public.resource.org/">Public.Resource.Org</a> was way ahead of us. When we started, one of our first steps was to add the data that he had collected, including the the complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports">United States Reports</a> going back to 1759, <a href="https://free.law/2011/08/25/second-series-of-federal-reporter-from-1950-to-1993-now-on-courtlistener/">the second series of the Federal Reporter</a>, and <a href="https://free.law/2012/05/13/announcing-the-third-series-of-the-federal-reporter/">volumes 1-491 of the third series of the Federal Reporter</a>. These sources added {{ count_pro|intcomma }} opinions to our collection.
        </p>
        <p>In 2013 we <a href="https://free.law/2013/10/30/free-law-project-adds-more-than-15m-opinions-to-its-collection-thanks-to-data-donation/">received a generous data donation from Lawbox, LLC</a> that contributed to {{ count_lawbox|intcomma }} opinions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Scrapers:</strong> Since 2010, we have gathered opinions directly from court websites via <a href="https://free.law/juriscraper/">our Juriscraper toolkit</a>. When we began, we only collected content from the federal Circuit courts and the Supreme Court, but as of now we run over 200 scrapers throughout every day. So far, they have contributed to {{ count_scraper|intcomma }} opinions. The supported courts <a href="#scraped-jurisdictions">are listed below</a>.
      </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Supreme Court Database (SCDB):</strong> The <a href="http://scdb.wustl.edu/">NSF-funded SCDB</a> is the gold standard for high-quality legal information, and we have <a href="https://free.law/2014/12/21/courtlistener-is-now-integrated-with-the-supreme-court-database/">linked it up with the data available in the United States Reports</a>. Doing this added parallel citations and other metadata to tens of thousands of SCOTUS opinions.
      </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Library of Congress:</strong> The Library of Congress released a PDF listing the filing dates for thousands of early historical Supreme Court cases. We have <a href="https://free.law/2011/05/25/updated-supreme-court-case-dates-and-the-first-release-of-early-scotus-data-in-machine-readable-form/">integrated these dates</a> so our users have the best information possible.
      </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We currently have one more source of judicial opinions that we plan to add to the above sources. When that is complete, we will perform an audit to ensure that every opinion from both WestLaw and LexisNexis are readily available to the public in high-quality, machine readable, and easily accessible formats. <a href="{% url "contact" %}">Get in touch</a> if you want to help support this historical project.
    </p>
    <p>We welcome additional data donations on our <a href="{% url "donate" %}?referrer=coverage">donate</a> page of any public domain legal data.
    </p>

    <h3 id="opinion-chart">Seeing Our Opinion Coverage</h3>
    <p>The chart below attempts to demonstrate the number of opinions we have in each jurisdiction in any given year. A few notes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the drop down to select a court to inspect.</li>
      <li>Bars can be clicked to view the opinions from that year.</li>
      <li>Counts below include both <a href="{% url "faq" %}#non-precedential">precendential and non-precedential</a> opinions.
      </li>
      <li>The large spike you may see in the Supreme Court in the early 2000's is due to denied
        certiorari's being included in the reporters during those years. This is not a data error.
      </li>
    </ol>

For the courts listed below, we gather their oral argument recordings within about an hour of when the files are posted.
    </p>
    <p>For many of these courts, we also laboriously gathered everything they had available on their website so that we'd have as complete a collection as possible.
