      <p>It is very simple to delete your account on CourtListener.</p>
      <p>
        When you do, we will immediately delete or anonymize all of the
        information associated with your account. This may include notes,
        alerts, tags, and a variety of other data that you may have saved to
        your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you delete your account you will no longer be able to export
        your data from your account or restore your account.
