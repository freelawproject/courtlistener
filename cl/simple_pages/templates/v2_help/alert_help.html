    <h1>Help with Search and Docket Alerts</h1>
    <p class="text-xl font-sans font-normal text-greyscale-700">Since 2009, CourtListener has helped people keep up with new cases and legal topics.</p>
    <p>We currently have three kinds of alerts: Search Alerts, Docket Alerts for PACER, and Citation Alerts.</p>
  </c-layout-with-navigation.section>

  {# Docket Alerts for PACER #}
  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="recap-alerts">
    <h2>Docket Alerts for PACER</h2>
    <p>Docket Alerts allow you to keep up with federal cases and bankruptcies in the PACER system. These alerts monitor tens of thousands of cases across the country for new docket entries and send emails and <a class="underline" href="{% url "webhooks_docs" %}">webhook events</a> whenever new data is found.
    </p>
    <p>Our alerts are only as good as our sources. To learn more about the data sources that trigger alerts see our <a class="underline" href="{% url "coverage_recap" %}">coverage page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For active cases, alerts can come within seconds of a new filing. For less active cases, it can take more time or alerts may not arrive at all, if we do not have a source of new information for that case.
    </p>
    <p>In the last 24 hours, {{ d_update_count|intcomma }} dockets and {{ de_update_count|intcomma }} docket entries were updated.
    </p>
  </c-layout-with-navigation.section>

  {# Limitations #}
  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="limitations">
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>As a non-profit, we aim to provide our services to as many people as possible. We currently allow <span class="bold">{{ MAX_FREE_DOCKET_ALERTS }}</span> docket alerts for free, and give a bonus of <span class="bold">{{ DOCKET_ALERT_RECAP_BONUS }}</span> alerts to anybody with the <a class="underline" href="https://free.law/recap/">RECAP Extension</a> installed.
    </p>
    <p>Members can create as many alerts as they need, though we may set up some reasonable limits in the future, based on usage.
    </p>
    <p>Corporate rates are available for large organizations needing to provide alerts to many users. This feature is intended for individual users. If you think you may need to use alerts for a commercial endeavor, please <a class="underline" href="{% url "contact" %}">get in touch</a>.
    </p>
    <p>We can sometimes provide need-based exceptions to these rates. If you might need an exception, <a class="underline" href="{% url "contact" %}">please let us know</a>.

  {# Creating a Docket Alert #}
  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="creating-docket-alert">
    <h3>Creating a Docket Alert</h3>
    <p>To create a RECAP Alert, find the docket you are interested in following, and press the button on the top that says, "Get Alerts":
    </p>
    <figure class="bg-greyscale-50 md:py-2 rounded-2xl">
      <img

        class="mx-auto"
        width="579"
        height="168">
    </figure>
    <p>That's all there is to it. You'll begin getting alerts as soon as the docket has a new docket entry.
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example of what an email might look like:</p>
    <figure class="bg-greyscale-50 md:py-2 pl-9 pt-6 rounded-2xl">

  {# Coverage gaps #}
  <section x-intersect.margin.-30%.0.-65%.0="show" id="coverage-gaps">
    <h3>Coverage Gaps</h3>
    <p>A major source we use for our alerts is RSS feeds provided by the courts. Even after supplementing these with <a class="underline" href="{% url "coverage_recap" %}">the sources listed on our coverage page</a>, we are not always able to provide complete coverage of everything new in PACER. The problem is that some courts do not provide RSS feeds, and others only provide partial ones. The lists below are updated around the clock and provide a summary of which courts provide RSS feeds.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-xl">Full RSS Feeds</h4>
    <p>The courts below have complete RSS feeds, allowing us to always know when cases in these courts are updated.</p>

    {# Full RSS Feeds #}
    {% regroup full_feeds by jurisdiction as full_feed_courts %}
    <c-tabs title="Full RSS Feeds Jurisdictions">
      {% for group in full_feed_courts %}

      {% endfor %}
    </c-tabs>

    {# Partial RSS Feeds #}
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <h4 class="text-xl">Partial RSS Feeds</h4>
      <p>The courts below only provide some types of documents in their RSS feeds. This means we can send alerts for the types of documents they support and for any content we get from other sources.
      </p>
      <p>You can see which docket entry types are provided by these courts below.</p>

      {% regroup partial_feeds by jurisdiction as partial_feed_courts %}
      <c-tabs title="Partial RSS Feeds Jurisdictions">
        {% for group in partial_feed_courts %}
          <c-tabs.tab name="{% if group.grouper == "FD" %}District Courts{% elif group.grouper == "FB" %}Bankruptcy Courts{% elif group.grouper == "F" %}Appellate Courts{% endif %}">

          </c-tabs.tab>
        {% endfor %}
      </c-tabs>

      <p>If you rely on one of these courts, we strongly encourage you to contact the court to request a full and complete PACER RSS feed.</p>
    </div>

    {# No RSS Feeds #}
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <h4 class="text-xl">No RSS Feeds</h4>
      <p>The courts below do not provide RSS feeds of their latest filings. This means our alerts will only be sent when we get updates from other sources.
      </p>

      {% regroup no_feeds by jurisdiction as no_feed_courts %}

  {# Search Alerts #}
  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="search-alerts">
    <h2>Search Alerts</h2>
    <p>Search alerts are triggered by our search engine and are a powerful way to get fine-tuned alerts on cases or topics that you are following.
    </p>
  </c-layout-with-navigation.section>

  {# Creating Search Alerts #}
  <section x-intersect.margin.-20%.0.-70%.0="show" id="creating-search-alerts">
    <h3>Creating Alerts</h3>
    <p>To create a Search Alert, begin with a search in CourtListener's Case Law, RECAP or Oral Argument database. You can set static calendar dates, or rolling <a class="underline" href="{% url "relative_dates" %}">relative dates</a> for your alerts. In the results page, click the bell icon in the search bar or click the Get Alerts button in the sidebar on the left.
    </p>
    <figure class="bg-greyscale-50 p-2 rounded-2xl">
      <img
        src="{% static "png/logo.png" %}"
        alt="screenshot of the search bar"
        class="max-w-full"
        height="76"
        width="">
    </figure>
    <p>After you click the bell icon or the Get Alerts button, you will see a pop-up like this, where you can see the filters applied to your alert, how many results it had over the past 100 days, and give it a name and frequency. For RECAP search alerts, you can also choose whether you want alerts for both cases and filings, or for cases only.
    </p>
    <figure class="bg-greyscale-50 p-2 rounded-2xl">
      <img
        src="{% static "png/logo.png" %}"
        alt="screenshot of the create alert form"
        class="max-w-full"
        height="400"
        width="">
    </figure>

    <p>The available rates are "Real Time," "Daily," "Weekly," "Monthly," or "Off." Real Time alerts for Case Law are usually delivered within about an hour of when something is published by the court. Real time alerts for oral arguments and the majority of RECAP alerts are batched and delivered every {{ rt_alerts_sending_rate }} minutes. Daily, weekly, and monthly alerts come at the end of the day, week, and month.
    </p>
    <p>Search alert webhooks for Case Law are delivered at the same time as the alert email. For Oral Argument alerts and the majority of RECAP alerts, webhooks are delivered immediately as we ingest the data, regardless of the alert rate.</p>
    <p>Alerts that are Off will not be run. This can be useful for temporarily disabling an alert.

  {# Limitations of RECAP Search Alerts #}
  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="recap-search-alerts-limitations">
    <h3>Limitations of RECAP Search Alerts</h3>
    <p> RECAP Search Alerts can be triggered by case-level fields, filing-level fields, or a combination of both. This flexibility introduces complexity, which leads to certain limitations when triggering real-time alerts. For example, suppose you have a real-time alert based on a query like:</p>
    <p><code>caseName:"Lorem vs Dolor" AND description:"Notice of Removal"</code></p>
    <p>Now imagine a case previously named <strong>"Ipsum vs Dolor"</strong> contains a filing with the description <strong>"Notice of Removal"</strong>. If the case name is later updated to <strong>"Lorem vs Dolor"</strong>, this case would now match the alert query. </p>
    <p>However, because the field that causes the match <code>caseName</code> is at the case level and not tied directly to the individual filing, CourtListener cannot detect that a relevant filing now qualifies for the alert. As a result, the alert will not be triggered in real time.
      Instead, edge-case alerts like this are processed at the end of the day using a different matching strategy. In such cases, the associated webhooks are also triggered at the end of the day, rather than in real time.</p>
    <p>Apart from the edge case described above, real-time search alert emails are triggered within {{ rt_alerts_sending_rate }} minutes of ingesting a case or filing that matches the alert criteria.</p>
    <h4 id="recap-search-alerts-party-limitations">Limitations with Text-Based Queries and Party Fields</h4>
    <p>Another known limitation of RECAP Search Alerts is that alerts do not support combined text-based queries involving both <code>party</code> or <code>attorney</code> fields and filing-level fields such as <code>description</code>. For example, the following query will not work as expected:</p>
    <p><code>party:"Michael Jordan" AND attorney:"LeBron James" AND description:goat</code></p>
    <p>This is because <code>party</code> and <code>attorney</code> values are only associated with dockets, not with individual filings, unlike other docket fields.</p>
    <p>As a workaround to build alerts that involve party and attorney conditions along with a filing description, use the sidebar filters instead of the main query box.</p>
  </c-layout-with-navigation.section>

  {# RECAP Search Alerts for Cases or Filings #}
  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="recap-cases-or-filings">
    <h3>RECAP Search Alerts for Cases or Filings</h3>
  <p>For RECAP Search Alerts, you can choose whether you’d like alerts for new cases only, or for both new cases and new filings:</p>

By clicking the Edit button, you will be taken back to the search screen with the alert configured for editing. There, you can refine your search, or the name or frequency of the alert.

  {# Supported Courts #}
  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="courts">
    <h3>Supported Courts</h3>
    <p>Search alerts are available for many jurisdictions across the country, and we are frequently expanding our system to support even more locations. To see which courts are currently supported, check <a class="underline" href="{% url "coverage" %}">our coverage pages</a>, where we list the jurisdictions that we regularly scrape for oral arguments or case law.
    </p>
    <p>If there is a jurisdiction that is not currently listed, please <a class="underline" href="{% url "contact" %}">express your interest</a>, and we will do our best to add it to our list.

  {# Citation Alerts #}
  <section x-intersect.margin.-80%.0.-65%.0="show" id="citation-alerts">
    <h2>Citation Alerts</h2>
    <p>Citation alerts make it possible to keep up with citations to a case of interest. For example, if you are following election law, you might want an alert whenever a new case cites existing landmark cases in your field.
    </p>
    <p>Citation alerts can be configured with custom queries, filters, or jurisdictions. This allows you to set up alerts like:

    </p>
    <blockquote>Whenever the Supreme Court cites <cite>Roe v. Wade</cite> and mentions the First Amendment, send me an email.</blockquote>
    <p>To create a citation alert, start at webpage for the case that interests you. In this example, we will use <a class="underline" href="/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/"><cite>Roe v. Wade</cite></a>.
    </p>
    <p>On that page, in the sidebar on the left, any cases that cite it are listed, and there is a button to "Get Citation Alerts":
    </p>
    <figure class="bg-greyscale-50 p-2 rounded-2xl">
      <img
        src="{% static "png/logo.png" %}"
        alt="screenshot of the citing opinions sidebar"
        class=""
        width=""
        height="253">
    </figure>

    <p>Clicking that button will perform a search in CourtListener that <a class="underline" href="/?q=cites%3A(108713)&show_alert_modal=yes" rel="nofollow">shows the case law that cites <cite>Roe v. Wade</cite></a>, and a dialog will appear where you can save the alert.</p>
    <p>If you prefer to modify the alert, you can close the dialog that appeared, tweak the query and filters you wish to apply, and then save it as you would any regular alert.
    </p>
    <p>For more on citation alerts, <a class="underline" href="https://free.law/2016/01/30/citation-searching/">see our blog post announcing this feature</a>.
