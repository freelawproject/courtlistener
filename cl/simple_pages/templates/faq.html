    <h4 id="who-and-what">What Is This Site? Who Runs It?</h4>
    <p>CourtListener is a legal research website currently containing <a href="{% url "coverage" %}">{{ total_opinion_count|intcomma }}</a> legal opinions from federal and state courts. CourtListener is operated by the non-profit <a href="https://free.law">Free Law Project</a>. Free Law Project seeks to provide free access to primary legal materials, develop legal research tools, and support academic research on legal corpora. CourtListener embodies all of these efforts, as the primary free repository of all the court opinions we have collected, as the platform on which we attempt to deploy legal research tools, and as the source of bulk downloads that enable academic researchers to study our collection.
    </p>


    <h4 id="legal-advice">Can you provide me with legal advice or help me with my case?</h4>
    <p>We're sorry, but we are unable to provide legal advice. You may wish to contact a qualified attorney. Many local bar associations, such as your local county bar association may operate a lawyer referral service through which you may be able to receive a no-cost or low-cost initial consultation. Justia <a href="https://www.justia.com/lawyers">maintains a lawyer directory</a> you may wish to look at, and their site also has a substantial amount of no-cost legal information.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, many counties operate a law library open to the general public. You may be able to receive general assistance with legal research questions from the law librarians there. Alternatively, if there is law school near you, the law librarians there may be able to assist you with general legal research questions.
    </p>


    <h4 id="contact">How Do I Contact You?</h4>
    <p>We can be contacted via the address on our <a href="{% url "contact" %}">contact form</a>, or via email at
        <a href="mailto:info@free.law">info@free.law</a>. If you require a secure channel when
        contacting us, please use the PGP key listed
        <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xDE79459CD047ACFE">here</a>.

    <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
    <h4 id="why-use">Why Should I Use This Site (And Not Something Else)?</h4>
    <p>While Free Law Project seeks to put the entirety of United States case law online, for the
        public, for free, we have not reached that goal yet. So, we hope you find what you are looking
        for here, but if not, you should absolutely use other sites too! Other no-cost sites include
        <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="http://www.justia.com/">
            Justia</a>. There are many fee-based sites too, such as <a href="http://fastcase.com/">Fastcase</a>.

    <h4 id="how-different">What Makes This Site Different from Other Sites that
        Put Legal Documents online?</h4>
    <p>Our site has a citator that shows you which subsequent opinions have cited to the opinion you
        are viewing, an important tool in researching whether a given precedent is still good law. Many free
        sites lack such a tool. We also think our search filters, advanced search options, and relevancy
        search enhancements that we call
        <a href="https://free.law/2013/11/12/courtlistener-improves-search-results-thanks-to-volunteer-contributor/">
            CiteGeist</a>, produce search results that are particularly impressive.</p>

    <p>Unlike many sites that may be several days or weeks behind, we strive to collect new opinions from
        the courts in near real time. For <a href="{% url "coverage" %}#scraped-jurisdictions">the courts we cover</a>, new
        opinions should typically appear within 30 minutes of being posted on the court's website.</p>

    <p>But the most important distinguishing factor about this site is that it is <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">open access</a>.
        Anyone can download all the source code we use to operate this site and run their own site that does exactly
        the same thing. And since our bulk downloads provide free access to our entire collection of opinions, we hope
        we've given our effort its own life that can continue no matter what. Many <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltLaw">people</a> <a
                href="http://library2.lawschool.cornell.edu/insiteasp/public/display_browse.asp?style=st_browse&id=1542&prevpage=1Legal">have</a> <a
                href="http://library2.lawschool.cornell.edu/insiteasp/public/display_browse.asp?style=st_browse&id=1207&prevpage=2Court">tried</a>
        to provide free access to U.S. case law, but when their efforts finally end, their collection and software
        typically disappears too and the next effort has to start over from the beginning. We hope instead to be the
        last people who ever have to attempt to collect the entirety of United States case law. Everyone who comes after
        can build upon this effort.</p>


    <h4 id="explain-alerts">What Are Alerts and How Do They Work?</h4>
    <p>You can sign up to receive free daily, weekly or monthly email alerts for
        any search query that interests you. When a new opinion matches your
        search, you'll get an email alert at about 5:30 Pacific time. If you
        have donated at least $10 in the last year, you can also set up real
        time alerts to get notified even more quickly.</p>

    <p>Get started by running a search and the "Create an Alert" option will be
        in the sidebar next to your results.
    </p>
    <p>Note that alerts are only currently supported in <a href="{% url "coverage" %}#scraped-jurisdictions">
        {{ scraped_court_count }} jurisdictions</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="real-time-alerts">What Are Real Time Alerts?</h4>
    <p>Real Time alerts are alerts that are triggered as soon as we find an
        item on a court website. Unlike regular alerts, these are sent out
        throughout the day, which takes considerable processing power (and thus
        expense). These alerts are only usually triggered within about half an
        hour from when an item appears on a court website.
    </p>

    <h4 id="explain-citations">How Do You Identify Citations?</h4>
    <p>It's not easy. Currently we only detect citaitons to court opinions. Citations to statutes, law
        review articles, or other resources are currently ignored. When a new document is added, we search
        the document text for standard case law citation formats and if we can match what we find with one (and
        only one) document in our collection, then we create a hyperlink from the original document's citation
        to the cited document, making it easier to browse through our collection. When there are multiple
        documents in our collection that appear to match the citation we use what we call "reverse matching"
        to try to resolve the citation. The case name from each potential match is searched in the original document
        and if there is only one match, then that becomes the linked citation.</p>

    <h4 id="oral-args">How Do You Get the Oral Arguments That You Have?</h4>
    <p>We get oral arguments by looking at court websites on approximately an
        hourly basis. We currently only check the sites listed on our <a
            href="{% url "coverage" %}#scraped-jurisdictions">coverage page</a>. Once we
        have downloaded an oral argument, we convert it to an MP3, downsample
        the audio for faster downloading, and add album art for your MP3
        player. When the file is ready, it is added to the site and it becomes
        available in search results, podcasts and bulk data.</p>


    <h3 id="supreme-court-networks">Supreme Court Citation Networks</h3>
    <h4 id="circles-change-size">Why do the case circles change size?</h4>
    <p>Circles change size based on the number of citations to it by other cases in the network. The more cases that cite to <i>Case A</i>, the larger it will be. The only exception to this rule is the rightmost case on network (with the most recent date). For visual clarity, this anchor case is always represented with a large circle.</p>

    <h4 id="what-cases-mean">How can I find out what the cases in my network mean?</h4>
    <p>This tool will not read the cases for you but it will make your reading more efficient. You can read opinion text directly by clicking on opinions in the visualization. You can see all the Supreme Court Database information for a case. Information will open in a separate window and includes issue area, legal provision involved, and detailed voting information. By using SCDB information and skimming opinion text, you can figure out what is going on in the case fairly quickly. Some networks also have helpful user descriptions. </p>

    <h4 id="default-two-degree">Why did my network default to 2-degrees?</h4>
    <p>We do not generate 3-degree networks when it will contain more than 70 cases. We have found networks larger than 70 are too unwieldy and so default those networks to 2-degrees.</p>

    <h4 id="case-missing">Why is a case missing from my network?</h4>
    <p>When the Supreme Court cites to recently decided cases, the citation form is non-standard such as citing to <i>Slip. Op</i> or <i>555 S.Ct ___</i>. This currently confounds our automatic citation parser. It's a problem we're working on.</p>

    <h4 id="embed-network">How do I embed a network in my blog?</h4>
    <p>On the network display page, the "Embed" box is on the right side of the page. Click in the box and copy the HTML code. You can then put this code in your WordPress blog (or Liguides site, or etc) just as you would embed a video from YouTube.</p>

    <h4 id="dod">What do you mean by "Degree of Dissent"?</h4>
    <p>We use <em>Degree of Dissent</em> (DoD) in our <a
            href="{% url "mapper_homepage" %}">visualizations of Supreme Court
        networks</a> to indicate the average level of disagreement in the cases
        shown. For example, in a network that shows two cases, each with
        unanimous 9-0 votes, there would be no dissent, and so the score would
        be 0. By contrast, if a network had only two cases, each with 5-4
        decisions, the DoD would be 1.0, indicating a highly
        dissenting network. Mathematically, the DoD for a given case is calculated by multiplying the number of dissents by 0.25. This means that a 9-0 case will have the same DoD as a 8-0 case (0.0) and a 6-3 will have the same DoD as 5-3 case.
    </p>
    <p>In some cases you may see that the DoD is not using all of the cases in a network, stating something like: "Degree of Dissent: 0.73 for 16 cases of 17." This occurs because some cases do not have vote information in the Supreme Court Database (Spaeth).
    </p>


    <h3 id="coverage-and-content">Coverage and Content</h3>
    <h4 id="what-coverage-exists">What Is Your Coverage of Legal Materials and
        How Comprehensive Is It?</h4>
    <p>See our <a href="{% url "coverage" %}">coverage</a> page for all the details. We are
        constantly working to fill gaps in our coverage, but until we have the entirety of United States case law,
        you should consult additional sources for any important legal research task.</p>
    <p>When we think we are closer to having everything, we intend to conduct an "audit" of our documents to
        confirm that we have every opinion that appears in the bound volumes of case law. Once that audit is complete,
        we will be able to post even more details about our coverage.</p>

    <h4 id="why-many-copies">Why Do Some Opinions Show Up More Than Once In
        Search Results?</h4>
    <p>CourtListener uses an automatic process to find and download opinions on court websites. This is an extremely
        efficient and effective method of finding new opinions as they are posted, but in some cases, a court will post
        several edits to an opinion. Sometimes these edits are for seemingly minor typos, but other times they can be
        the result of something more interesting, like <a
                href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/antonin-scalia-error-supreme-court-dissent-epa">a judicial
            blunder</a>. When this happens, we maintain an archive of all of the versions of that opinion.
    </p>
    <p>We've discussed this topic in more depth <a
            href="https://free.law/2014/05/03/detecting-judicial-corrections/">on our blog</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="why-my-case">Why Is The Opinion In My Case Appearing On This Site?</h4>
    <p>Court opinions are public records and create the precedents that determine the results in future cases.
        Court opinions contain statements of the law and legal reasoning that guide legal researchers. We are
        attempting to build a site useful to legal researchers. If you have a concern about information from one
        of these opinions appearing in search engines, such as Google, you should review our <a
                href="/removal/">removal policy</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="non-precedential">Why Does This Site Contain Documents That Say "Not for Publication",
        "Unpublished", Etc?</h4>
    <p>In many jurisdictions of the United States, these statements do not mean that the case should not be
        published. Instead, it means that the issuing court is claiming they should not be used as a precedent in
        subsequent cases. You can read more about this policy <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-publication_of_legal_opinions_in_the_United_States">on
            Wikipedia</a>, if you are interested in the details.
    </p>

    <h4 id="explain-pin-cites">What Are the Gray Numbers That Appear in the
        Middle of Many Opinions?</h4>
    <p>These numbers correspond to the page numbers in the original books where these opinions were first published,
        and are commonly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_citation">pin-cites</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="explain-neutral-citations">What Are Neutral Citations and Why Do
        You Promote Them?</h4>
    <p>Historically, citations have corresponded to the location in a book where an opinion could be found. But for
        online systems like CourtListener this presents a number of problems. First, there's the obvious problem that
        when an opinion is created by a court and posted on its website, there is no way to refer to it until it is
        published in a book. In a post-Internet world, this is an unusual and unfortunate outcome. Second, there is
        no clear way for a system like CourtListener to determine the citation for an opinion once the opinion has been
        published, short of getting the book for each opinion and looking it up by hand.
    </p>
    <p>Neutral citations are a ground-swell effort to fix these problems by asking the courts themselves to affix
        citations to their work as they publish opinions on their websites. The system is very simple and takes the
        form of YEAR JURISDICTION NUMBER. So, for example, the first opinion from North Dakota in 2013 becomes <a
                href="/nd/5BmV/holkesvig-v-state/">2013 ND 1</a>. It's a very simple system that any court can begin
        using, and which many already have. We encourage all jurisdictions to adopt this system.
    </p>
    <p>Neutral citations have been officially recommended by the <a
            href="http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html">American Association
        of Law Libraries since 1995</a> and by the <a
            href="http://www.abanet.org/tech/ltrc/research/citation/report.html">American Bar Association since
        1996</a>. You can read more about neutral citations on the <a
            href="http://onward.justia.com/2010/12/17/public-domain-legal-citations/">Justia blog</a> or at <a
            href="http://universalcitation.org/">the website where they are being promoted</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="why-bulk">Why Do You Provide Bulk Data Files?</h4>
    <p>Two groups tend to find this useful. First are academic researchers who wish to do empirical research
        on large portions of U.S. case law. They often cannot answer certain questions with full generality without
        including all or almost all opinions in their research. Second are legal technology startups or those who
        want to test out some new legal research tool. These groups can use the documents we have collected to test
        out a prototype of their new tools. Most regular users will not need to use our bulk downloads.</p>

    <h4 id="explain-fingerprint">What Is the "Fingerprint" of the Document?</h4>
    <p>We generate these digital fingerprints for each document we retrieve from court websites. The algorithm that
        generates the fingerprint guarantees that the fingerprint generated will be unique for every file. If even
        one character is changed in a document, a different fingerprint will be generated. This helps us in our document
        retrieval process, so that if a court uses the same file name for a different document we will still detect
        that the document has changed and know to save it. This means it also helps us detect the rare instances where a
        file might be corrupted during the download process.
    </p>
    <p>If courts would publish these fingerprints as well, then we could develop tools that would allow our users
        to confirm that the backup copy on our site is identical to the version released by the court. Without that,
        users that wish to verify the authenticity of our backup copies would have to engage in the cumbersome process of
        downloading the document from the court, generating the fingerprint, download the document from us, generating
        the fingerprint from that copy, and then comparing the fingerprints to confirm that they are identical.
    </p>

    <h4 id="kinds-of-help">What Kinds of Help Do You Need?</h4>
    <p>As a start-up non-profit, we always need many varieties of help. Our
        biggest goals revolve around new features for the site, which you can
        see in our <a href="https://trello.com/b/F3jrqway/flp-projects">feature
            tracker</a>. We also need the help of designers, lawyers, legal
        researchers and non-profit fundraisers. If you think you can help,
        please <a href="{% url "contact" %}">get in touch</a>. We would love to hear from
        you.
    </p>
    <p>Another simple way to help is to <a
            href="{% url "donate" %}?referrer=faq">support our efforts
        financially</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="how-supported">How is the Project Supported?</h4>
    <p>CourtListener and Free Law Project are currently supported by volunteer
        contributors who donate their time to making the legal landscape more
        fair. Financially, we are in the running for several startup seeds and
        we rely on sustaining donations from our users. We also recently added
        advertising to the site, but it only accounts for less than 5% of our
        budget.
    </p>

    <h4 id="can-i-contribute">Can I Contribute to the Project Somehow?</h4>
    <p>Yes! Absolutely. Read our <a href="{% url "contribute" %}">page about getting
        involved</a> or simply <a
            href="mailto:volunteer@free.law">send us an email</a>

    </p>

    <h3 id="past-and-future">Past and Future</h3>
    <h4 id="orgin-story">What's the History of CourtListener?</h4>
    <p>CourtListener was Michael Lissner's capstone project while a student at
        the <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">University of California,
            Berkeley, School of Information</a>, where he was advised by
        Brian Carver. The site <a
                href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/blog/announcing-courtlistener">was
            launched in 2010</a> as a simple alert service for the Federal
        Appeals Courts. At that time, it had about 130,000 opinions, a
        different search engine, and an extremely sparse interface.
    </p>

    <p>In 2013, Michael and Brian <a
            href="https://free.law/2013/09/24/non-profit-free-law-project-formed-to-create-an-open-legal-ecosystem/">created
        Free Law Project</a> to support CourtListener and other related
        efforts.
    </p>
