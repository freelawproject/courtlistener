    <h1>Contributing to CourtListener and Free&nbsp;Law&nbsp;Project</h1>
    <p class="lead">CourtListener is an initiative of Free Law Project, a 501(c)(3) non-profit that uses advocacy and software to make the legal sector more competitive and equitable. We always need help to accomplish our goals.
    </p>
    <p>If you are looking to support our work, the first thing you can do to help is donate to Free Law Project or join us as a member. This allows us to hire more full time staff. It can be uncomfortable to say so directly, but nothing makes as big a difference as financial support. Please consider donating or becoming a member if you can.

    <h3>As a Software Developer</h3>
    <p>All of our code is open source and we have more work than we can ever complete.</p>
    <p>If you want to contribute to our work, get in touch with an email noting your skills and time availability. If you have a recent résumé, include it. When we get your email, we'll try to think of a project that'd be right for you.
    </p>
    <p>We also maintain a project board for volunteer developers, where you can sometimes just grab something to work on.</p>

    <h3 id="as-a-journalist">As a Journalist</h3>
    <p>You probably know what to do: Use our links and tell people about our initiatives.</p>
    <p>Beyond this, we hope you'll use and evangelize <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline" href="https://free.law/recap/">RECAP</a> and <a class="text-primary-600" href="{% url "alert_help" %}">our alerts system</a>. Some news organizations pay for alert subscriptions. Maybe you know the decision-maker at your organization?

  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="as-a-librarian">
    <h3>As a Librarian</h3>
    <p>We need help getting the next generation of users. Library Guides help! If you can write guides about our materials and put them on your library's website, that really helps get the word out. Let us know if you have questions while developing any kind of material.
    </p>
    <p>If you have time to volunteer, we regularly need research or data gathering help and have a #librarians channel in our Slack workspace where we hope you'll hang out. Get in touch to get started.
    </p>

  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="as-an-attorney">
    <h3>As an Attorney</h3>
    <p>If you are an attorney that works in federal court, we encourage you to use <a class="text-primary-600" href="{% url "recap_email_help" %}">@recap.email</a> so all of your cases are automatically available to the public. If you like, it can be done <a class="text-primary-600" href="{% url "recap_email_help" %}#whats-the-best-way-to-simply-contribute-to-the%C2%A0cause">somewhat anonymously</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Beyond this, if you're using our system, we hope you'll give us your feedback. The legal space is endlessly complicated, but we can often make changes to address newly identified corner cases or issues.
