                <p>Podcasts allow you to subscribe to oral argument audio as it is
                    published by a court. Instead of having to regularly go to the
                    court website to hear the latest oral arguments, you can simply
                    subscribe to a podcast and it will show up in your audio player.
                </p>
                <p>The podcasts we provide require ongoing maintenance.
                    We are able to add and support more podcasts as we receive
                    <a href="{% url "donate" %}?referrer=podcasts">support
                    from you.</a>

        <h2>How to Subscribe</h2>
        <p>Subscribing to our podcasts can be done in a few different ways. If you're an expert user, you can use any of the links below to subscribe to a podcast for that court or you can create your own podcast using the instructions below.

                <h3>iTunes Support</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, iTunes does not support podcasts with strong encryption. This means that we have the choice of either lowering the security of the entire site or of simply not supporting iTunes. Until they offer better support, we have chosen the latter.

        <h2>Creating a Custom Podcast</h2>
        <p>Creating a custom podcast is easy. Simply do a search for oral arguments, and then click the podcast icon (<i class="gray fa fa-rss"></i>) at the top of the page. You can create a podcast for any term or jurisdiction that you can use in a search. For example, it's simple to create a podcast for multiple jurisdictions or for only cases containing "United States", or anything else you can think of.
        </p>
        <p>Podcasts created this way will need to be manually added to your music player.</p>
