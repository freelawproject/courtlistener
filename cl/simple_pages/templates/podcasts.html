      <p>Podcasts allow you to subscribe to oral argument audio as it is
          published by a court. Instead of having to regularly go to the
          court website to hear the latest oral arguments, you can simply
          subscribe to a podcast and it will show up in your audio player.
      </p>
      <p>The podcasts we provide require ongoing maintenance. We are able to add and support more podcasts as we receive your support.

  <h3>Using a Podcast App</h3>
  <p>
    Our podcasts are available in a number of music services and apps. To find our podcasts, just search for "CourtListener".
  </p>

  <h2>Creating a Custom Podcast</h2>
  <p>Creating a custom podcast is easy. Simply do a search for oral arguments, and then click the podcast icon (<i class="gray fa fa-rss"></i>) at the top of the page. You can create a podcast for any term or jurisdiction that you can use in a search. For example, it's simple to create a podcast for multiple jurisdictions or for only cases containing "United States", or anything else you can think of.
  </p>
  <p>Podcasts created this way will need to be manually added to your music player.</p>
