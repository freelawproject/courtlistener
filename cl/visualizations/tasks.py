    Idea here is that somebody will create a new page that embeds one of our

    great. Unfortunately, in many cases, the HTTP referer we receive is that of
    an in progress page or similar, NOT the page that's actually live. Thus,
    what we do is try the URL over and over, until we find success.

    If a title is found, the admins are notified.

    it should have existed).
