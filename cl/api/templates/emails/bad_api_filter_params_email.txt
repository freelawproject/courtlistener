Hello{% if name %} {{ name }}{% endif %},

We're writing to let you know that in the last 24 hours we detected API
requests from your account that include invalid GET parameters our system
doesn't recognize. In the coming days, we will begin returning HTTP 400 errors
for such requests.

This email is your advance notice and your opportunity to address this issue.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. This change is necessary to
protect the integrity of our system and ensure that all API users receive
accurate, filtered results. When invalid filter parameters are used, they are
silently ignored, which can lead to unexpected results—often returning far more
data than intended. Previously, this was not a common problem, but a plethora
of vibe-coded solutions now regularly trigger very heavy usage of our system
that we need to urgently address.


YOUR AFFECTED API REQUESTS
--------------------------
{% for endpoint, params in params_by_endpoint.items %}
Endpoint: {{ endpoint }}
{% for param in params %}  - Parameter "{{ param.param }}" was used {{ param.count }} time(s)
    First seen: {{ param.first_seen }}
    Last seen: {{ param.last_seen }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
Total requests with invalid parameters: {{ total_count }}


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
-------------------
Please review your API integration code and remove or correct the invalid
filter parameters listed above. You can find the complete list of valid filter
parameters for each endpoint in our API documentation:

    https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/rest/

If you're using a library or tool that generates these parameters, you may need
to update its configuration or contact its maintainers.


QUESTIONS?
----------
If you have questions about this change or need help updating your integration,
please post on our discussion forum:

    https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener/discussions/

Our community and team members are happy to help you resolve any issues.

This is a rapid change to our APIs that we are considering a fix, not a
backwards incompatibility. The only functionality we are removing is the
ability to use the API incorrectly, which should help fix clients that are not
working properly.

This email will be re-sent with daily updates until {{ enforcement_date|date:"F jS, Y" }}
when we will begin blocking these requests instead of simply alerting about them.

We hope you understand, and we appreciate your assistance making our APIs work
well for all of our users.
