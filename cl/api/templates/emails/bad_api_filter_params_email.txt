Hello{% if name %} {{ name }}{% endif %},

We're writing to let you know that we've detected API requests from your
account that include filter parameters our system doesn't recognize. We wanted
to give you advance notice because we'll soon be updating our API to reject
requests that contain unknown filter parameters.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. This change is necessary to
protect the integrity of our system and ensure that all API users receive
accurate, filtered results. When invalid filter parameters are used, they are
silently ignored, which can lead to unexpected results—often returning far more
data than intended.


YOUR AFFECTED API REQUESTS
--------------------------
{% for endpoint, params in params_by_endpoint.items %}
Endpoint: {{ endpoint }}
{% for param in params %}  - Parameter "{{ param.param }}" was used {{ param.count }} time(s)
    First seen: {{ param.first_seen }}
    Last seen: {{ param.last_seen }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
Total requests with invalid parameters: {{ total_count }}


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
-------------------
Please review your API integration code and remove or correct the invalid
filter parameters listed above. You can find the complete list of valid filter
parameters for each endpoint in our API documentation:

    https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/rest/

If you're using a library or tool that generates these parameters, you may need
to update its configuration or contact its maintainers.
