    <h1>Financial Disclosures&nbsp;API</h1>
    <p class="text-xl font-sans font-normal text-greyscale-700">Use these APIs to work with financial disclosure records of current and former federal judges.</p>
    <p>This data was collected from senate records and information requests we sent to the federal judiciary. You can learn more about which disclosures are included and the limitations of these APIs on <a class="underline" href="{% url "coverage_fds" %}">our coverage page for financial disclosures</a>.</p>
    <p>Judicial officers and certain judicial employees in the United States are required to file financial disclosure reports by <a class="underline" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5a/compiledact-95-521/title-I">Title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978</a>. The Act requires that designated federal officials publicly disclose their personal financial interests to ensure confidence in the integrity of the federal government by demonstrating that they are able to carry out their duties without compromising the public trust.</p>
    <p>These APIs were used by the Wall Street Journal in <a class="underline" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/131-federal-judges-broke-the-law-by-hearing-cases-where-they-had-a-financial-interest-11632834421">their 17-part exposé</a> about the hidden conflicts of federal judges. That led to Congress passing the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act to put this information online. It was also used by ProPublica in <a class="underline" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow">their Pulitzer prize winning reporting</a> about failures to disclose gifts and perks.</p>
    <p>This data is updated in partnership with organizations using it. Please <a class="underline" href="{% url "contact" %}">get in touch</a> if you would like to work together to process and ingest the latest disclosure records.</p>

  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="understanding">
    <h3>Understanding the Fields</h3>
    <p>Like most of our APIs, field definitions can be obtained by sending an HTTP <code>OPTIONS</code> request to any of the APIs. For example, this request, piped through <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/jqlang/jq"><code>jq</code></a>, shows you the fields of the Gifts API:</p>
    <c-code>curl -X OPTIONS "{% get_full_host %}{% url "gift-list" version=version %}" \
    | jq '.actions.POST'

{
  "resource_uri": {

  },

    <p>Note that each field has the following attributes:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong><code>type</code></strong>: Indicating the object type for the field.</li>
      <li><strong><code>required</code></strong>: Indicating whether the field can have null values. Note that string fields will be blank instead of null.</li>
      <li><strong><code>read_only</code></strong>: Indicates whether the field can be updated by users (this does not apply to read-only APIs like the financial disclosure APIs).</li>
      <li><strong><code>label</code></strong>: This is a human-readable form for the field's name.</li>
      <li><strong><code>help_text</code></strong>: This explains the meaning of the field.</li>
    </ul>
  </c-layout-with-navigation.section>

  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="redactions">
    <h3>Redactions</h3>
    <p>For security reasons, filers can redact information on their disclosure forms. When a line in a disclosure contains a redaction, we will attempt to set the <code>redacted</code> field on that row to <code>True</code>. This is your hint that you may want to investigate that row more carefully.</p>
    <p>This field can be used as a filter. For example, here are all the investments with redacted information:</p>
    <c-code>curl "{% get_full_host %}{% url "investment-list" version=version %}?redacted=True" \
  --header 'Authorization: Token {% if user.is_authenticated %}{{ user.auth_token }}{% else %}&lt;your-token-here&gt;{% endif %}'

    },
...</c-code>
  </c-layout-with-navigation.section>

  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="value-codes">
    <h3>Value Codes</h3>
    <p>Several APIs, including <code>Investments</code>, <code>Debts</code>,and <code>Gifts</code> use form-based value codes to indicate monetary ranges instead of exact values. For example, the letter "J" indicates a value of $1–15,000.</p>
    <p>Place an <code>OPTIONS</code> request to these endpoints to learn the values of those fields or look in a PDF filing to see the key.</p>
    <p>Regrettably, these fields have not been updated by the judiciary in many years, so the highest value code only goes up to $50,000,000. For some judges, this may not be enough to accurately reflect their wealth.</p>
  </c-layout-with-navigation.section>

  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="inferred-values">
    <h3>Inferred Values</h3>
    <p><code>Investment</code> objects contain the field <code>has_inferred_values</code>. This field indicates that we inferred information about an investment based on the layout of the data in the disclosure form.</p>
    <p>For example, an investment could have been bought in Q1, while a dividend was paid out in Q2 before being sold in Q4. Often, after the first entry of the investment, later rows in the table are mostly blank. In this instance, we infer the values.</p>
    <p>The table below gives a brief example where we would infer that the blank cell below the cell for <code>AAPL</code> also refers to <code>AAPL</code>:</p>
    <c-data-table
      safe
      caption="Example of inferred values in investment data"
      :columns="[
        {'label': 'Description', 'field': 'description'},
        {'label': 'Date', 'field': 'date'},
        {'label': 'Type', 'field': 'type'},
      ]"
      :rows="[
        {
          'description': 'AAPL',
          'date': '2020-01-01',
          'type': 'Bought',
        },
        {
          'description': '&mdash;',
          'date': '2020-02-01',
          'type': 'Sold',
        },
      ]"
    ></c-data-table>
    <p>In this (slightly contrived) example our database would have two rows in the <code>Investment</code> table. The first would be for the purchase of the <code>AAPL</code> stock, and the second would be for the sale of it.</p>
  </c-layout-with-navigation.section>

  <c-layout-with-navigation.section id="examples">
    <h2>API Examples</h2>
    <p>You can query for investments by stock name, transaction dates and even gross values. For example, the following query is for financial disclosures with individual investments valued above $50,000,000.00. Note that this uses a value code as explained in the general notes above:</p>
    <c-code>curl "{% get_full_host %}{% url "investment-list" version=version %}?gross_value_code=P4&fields=investments" \
  --header 'Authorization: Token {% if user.is_authenticated %}{{ user.auth_token }}{% else %}&lt;your-token-here&gt;{% endif %}'</c-code>
    <p>Additionally, you could pinpoint gifts of individual judges when combining the gift database with our judicial database. The following query returns all reported gifts by the late <a class="underline" href="{% url "view_person" 1213 "ruth-bader-ginsberg" %}">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> (her ID is 1213):</p>
    <c-code>curl "{% get_full_host %}{% url "financialdisclosure-list" version=version %}?person=1213&fields=gifts" \
  --header 'Authorization: Token {% if user.is_authenticated %}{{ user.auth_token }}{% else %}&lt;your-token-here&gt;{% endif %}'</c-code>
    <p>In 2024, we presented these APIs at the NICAR conference and created <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/freelawproject/talks/tree/main/talks/2024/march/NICAR/cracking_the_courts_panel/examples">many more examples</a> you can explore.</p>
