  <h1 id="about">V4 API Migration Guide</h1>
  <h2 id="whats-happening">What's Happening?</h2>
  <p>
    After several years of planning and development, we have released v4 of our APIs. In conjunction with this migration,
    we are replacing our Solr search engine with an ElasticSearch cluster. v4 of the API responds to feedback we
    have received over the years, and should be much better for our users — faster, more featureful, more scalable, and more accurate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, we couldn't make these new APIs completely backwards compatible, so this guide explains the changes
    in the new APIs and what it will take to migrate to them.
  </p>
  <h2 id="timeline-changes">Timeline for Changes</h2>
  <p>v4 of the API is available now and is the default version for anybody creating new systems. Before its full release, a number of organizations beta tested it.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of our APIs except for our search API are powered by our database. We do not have plans at present to deprecate
    any of these APIs, but we'd like to remove them someday and urge you to migrate to v4 as soon as possible so we can do that.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, the v3 Search API is currently powered by Solr. v4 is powered by ElasticSearch. In <strong>nine weeks</strong>, we aim to switch v3 so it uses ElasticSearch too.
    This will change v3 in small backwards incompatible ways, but will allow us to continue supporting it even after turning off our Solr server.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are a v3 Search API user, you will soon get an email from us to communicate and discuss timelines.
  </p>
  <h2 id="what-if-do-nothing">What If I Do Nothing?</h2>
  <p>
    You might be fine. Most of the database and search APIs are only changing slightly and v3 will be supported for some period of time.
    But you should read this guide to see if any changes are needed to your application.
  </p>
  <p>The remainder of this guide is in three section:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New features you can expect</li>
    <li>How to migrate database APIs</li>
    <li>How to migrate search APIs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We're very excited to be releasing v4 of our APIs. We hope you will review these changes so we can all have a smooth transition.
  </p>
  <h2 id="what-to-expect">What New Features Can I Expect?</h2>
  <h3 id="cursor-pagination">Cursor-based pagination</h3>
  <p>Our database-powered APIs now support cursor-based pagination. This allows you to crawl very deeply in the API. In v3, any page past 100 was blocked.
  </p>
  <h3 id="elasticsearch">ElasticSearch</h3>
  <p>v4 of the Search API is powered by ElasticSearch instead of Solr. This is a huge upgrade to our API and search engine.
  </p>
  <p>Some of the improvements include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In v4, all PACER cases are now searchable. In v3 you only got results if a case had a docket entry.
    </li>
    <li>You can search for PACER filings based on what decisions they cite.
    </li>
    <li>You can now search for exact words like "Deposit" and not get back results for things like "Deposition."
    </li>
    <li>We've added about 800 legal acronyms like "IRS" to make sure those bring back results.
    </li>
    <li>Better relevancy for edge cases:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Small words like "of," "to," and "the" are now searchable.</li>
      <li>Camelcase words like "McDonalds" are more searchable.</li>
      <li>Highlighting is more consistent and can be disabled for better performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Emojis and unicode characters are now searchable.</li>
    <li>Docket number and other fielded searches are more robust.</li>
    <li>Timezone handling is more consistent.</li>
    <li>We've added a number of new searchable fields.
 </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes to v3 of the Search API</h2>
  <p>We cannot continue running Solr forever, but we can do our best to support v3 of the API. To do this, on <strong>XXXDATEXXX</strong>,
    v3 of the Search API will be upgraded to use Elastic behind the scenes. This will cause some breaking changes.
    If you have not migrated to v4 when we make this swap, these are the breaking changes you should prepare for:
  </p>
  <h3 id="recap-breaking-changes">RECAP (type=r)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fields removed:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>attorney</li>
      <li>attorney_id</li>
      <li>firm</li>
      <li>firm_id</li>
      <li>party</li>
      <li>party_id</li>
      <li>docket_absolute_url</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Fielded text queries that includes party fields won't work, for instance:
      <p><code>firm_id:1245 AND party:(United States)</code></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
      <li>The <code>type=d</code> uses a cardinality aggregation to compute the result count, which has an error of ±6% if results are over 2000.
      </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="opinions-breaking-changes">Opinions (type=o)</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Fields removed:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>caseNameShort</li>
        <li>pagerank</li>
        <li>status_exact</li>
        <li>non_participating_judge_ids</li>
        <li>source</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Field added:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>date_created</li>
      </ul>
      <li><code>snippet</code> has changed. In the Solr version, it included content from all fields, while in ES it displays only the Opinion text content.
      </li>
      <li>The <code>type=o</code> uses a cardinality aggregation to compute the result count, which has an error of ±6% if results are over 2000 hits.
      </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="oa-breaking-changes">Oral Arguments (type=oa)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In this case, the API response will be fully compatible with the Solr version.</li>
    <li>The only change is in the content of the <code>snippet</code> field, which previously stored different audio fields in Solr. Now, it stores the audio transcription.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="people-breaking-changes">People</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No breaking changes. V3 is currently working on ES.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="migrate-db-apis">How Do I Migrate Database APIs?</h2>
  <h3 id="total-count-results">Total count of results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The total count of the results is no longer available in the response.
      Most users don't need this when crawling the API, and computing the count for each response slows down the API.
      If this value is essential to your service, let us know so we can discuss adding a new API with this feature.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="invalid-cursor">Invalid cursor error code: 404</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A new type of error found in the V4 API is <strong>Invalid cursor</strong> with a 404 status code.</li>
    <li>This error can occur if a user starts a request using one sorting key, then switches to a different one without clearing the cursor from the parameters.
      For example:
      <p>First request: <code>/api/rest/v4/dockets/?cursor=cD0yMDI0LTA4LTA5KzE4JTNBMTMlM0E1Ny4xODQ0MjUlMkIwMCUzQTAw&amp;order_by=date_created</code>
      </p>
      <p>Second request: <code>/api/rest/v4/dockets/?cursor=cD0yMDI0LTA4LTA5KzE4JTNBMTMlM0E1Ny4xODQ0MjUlMkIwMCUzQTAw&amp;order_by=id</code>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>The reason for this error is that cursor pagination maintains the original sorting key type for consistency.
      If the new key type does not match the one stored in the cursor, the error is triggered.
    </li>
    <li>Additionally, if a user starts pagination with a key that supports cursor pagination and then switches to one that doesn't, the cursor parameter in the request will be ignored, and the new request will start from page 1.
      Similarly, if the user begins with a non-cursor key and switches to one that supports CBP, the <code>page</code> parameter will be ignored, and the request will restart from page 1.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="migrate-search-apis">How Do I Migrate the Search API?</h2>
  <h3 id="enhancements-v4">Enhancements in v4</h3>
  <h4 id="enhancements-cursor-pagination">Search API crawls are no longer limited to 100 pages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Deep pagination of search results is now possible.</li>
    <li>Users cannot directly jump to a specific page. Look at and follow the <code>next</code> and <code>previous</code> parameters provided in each response. Navigation of the API is exclusively through those keys in each API response.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="enhancements-results-sorting">Result sorting is more consistent</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>When sorting the API results, we now add a tie-breaking field to all responses. This ensures that ordering is consistent even when the ordering key has identical values for multiple results.
    </li>
    <li>If your sorting field has null values, those results will be sorted at the end of the query, regardless of whether you sort in ascending or descending order.
      For example if you sort by a date that is null for an opinion, that opinion will go at the end of the result set.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="enhancements-highlighting">Highlighting is more consistent</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>When enabled, highlighting will more consistently highlight the fields in the response.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="enhancements-empty-fields">Empty fields are standardized</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Empty fields are now more consistent in their response types, and follow the conventions provided by Django.
        This means that dates, date times, and integers return <code>null</code>, strings return an empty string, and lists return an empty array.
      </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="v4-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards incompatible changes in v4</h3>
  <h4 id="backwards-estimated-counts">High query counts are estimated</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To enhance performance, query counts above 2,000 hits are approximate.
      For those exceeding this threshold, counts can be off by as much as six percent.
      We recommend noting this in your interface by saying something like, "About 5,000 results," instead of presenting the value as exact.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-highlighting">Highlighting</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To enhance performance, results are not highlighted by default. To enable highlighting, include <code>highlight=on</code> in your request.
    </li>
    <li>When highlighting is disabled, the first 500 characters of <code>snippet</code> fields are returned for types <code>o</code>, <code>r</code>, and <code>rd</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-nested-keys">Nested keys (documents) for <code>type=o</code> and <code>type=p</code></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To enhance the structure of the API, sub-opinions are now nested within clusters in case law results (<code>type=o</code>), and <code>positions</code> are nested within judges in judge results (<code>type=p</code>).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-type-r"><code>type=r</code> is now for dockets with nested documents</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To align the API results with the front end results, <code>type=r</code> no longer returns a flat list of documents.
      Instead, it now returns a list of dockets with up to three matching documents nested within each docket's <code>recap_documents</code> key.
    </li>
    <li>To return a flat list of documents, as in the past, try the new <code>type=rd</code> parameter.
      This can be useful for those upgrading from v3 to v4 of the search API.
    </li>
    <li>If there are more than three matching documents, the <code>more_docs</code> field for the docket result will be true.
      As in the front end, you can get the remaining documents for a docket by placing a docket ID query like:
      <code>type=rd&amp;q=(original query) AND docket_id:XYZ</code>
    </li>
    <li>This response type includes two counts of the results: <code>count</code> is the number of dockets returned. <code>document_count</code> is the number of documents.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-type-rd"><code>type=rd</code> is a new result type for documents</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><code>type=rd</code> returns a flat list of PACER documents, and is similar to <code>type=r</code> in v3 of the API.
      Results for this type can be queried by any docket fields except the <code>party</code> and <code>attorney</code> fields.
    </li>
    <li>The field differences between <code>r</code> in v3 and <code>rd</code> in v4 are that all the docket-level fields were removed:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>assignedTo</li>
      <li>assigned_to_id</li>
      <li>caseName</li>
      <li>cause</li>
      <li>court</li>
      <li>court_citation_string</li>
      <li>court_exact</li>
      <li>court_id</li>
      <li>dateArgued</li>
      <li>dateFiled</li>
      <li>dateTerminated</li>
      <li>docketNumber</li>
      <li>jurisdictionType</li>
      <li>juryDemand</li>
      <li>referredTo</li>
      <li>referred_to_id</li>
      <li>suitNature</li>
    </ul>
    <li><code>docket_id</code> is still available in the <code>rd</code> type so users can identify the docket and pull additional docket data from the docket API.
    </li>
    <li>One field that changed is <code>entry_date_filed</code>. In <code>r</code> v3, it was a <code>datetime</code> field with PST midnight as the default time.
      Now, it's simply a date field.
    </li>
    <li>The <code>timestamp</code> field has been moved to the new <code>meta</code> field, which also contains <code>date_created</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-type-d"><code>type=d</code> still returns dockets</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><code>type=d</code> returns dockets without nested documents. If all you need in the response is the docket information, this response type will be significantly faster.
      You can query document fields with this response type even though they will not be returned.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-removed-fields">Removed fields</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The following fields have been removed from the case law search results (<code>type=o</code>):
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>caseNameShort</li>
      <li>pagerank</li>
      <li>status_exact</li>
      <li>non_participating_judge_ids</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-changed-fields">Changed field values</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>For legibility, in the case law search results (<code>type=o</code>), some <code>type</code> field values have changed:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>010combined → combined-opinion</li>
      <li>015unamimous → unanimous-opinion</li>
      <li>020lead → lead-opinion</li>
      <li>025plurality → plurality-opinion</li>
      <li>030concurrence → concurrence-opinion</li>
      <li>035concurrenceinpart → in-part-opinion</li>
      <li>040dissent → dissent</li>
      <li>050addendum → addendum</li>
      <li>060remittitur → remittitur</li>
      <li>070rehearing → rehearing</li>
      <li>080onthemerits → on-the-merits</li>
      <li>090onmotiontostrike → on-motion-to-strike</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Some of the values of the <code>status</code> field in the case law search results have changed:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>precedential → published</li>
      <li>non-precedential → unpublished</li>
      <li>errata → errata</li>
      <li>separate opinion → separate</li>
      <li>in-chambers → in-chambers</li>
      <li>relating-to orders → relating-to</li>
      <li>unknown status → unknown</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The <code>snippet</code> field in the case law search results previously included more than one opinion text field.
      It now only contains the best text field, based on the following priority and determined by availability:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>html_columbia</li>
      <li>html_lawbox</li>
      <li>xml_harvard</li>
      <li>html_anon_2020</li>
      <li>html</li>
      <li>plain_text</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-date-times">Dates and times</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>All dates and times are in UTC instead of PST.</li>
    <li>Date objects are now rendered as an ISO-8601 date instead of an ISO-8601 datetime.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following is a full list of date fields that are now date objects (rather than datetime objects, which they were in v3):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>types <code>r</code> and <code>d</code>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>dateArgued</li>
      <li>dateFiled</li>
      <li>dateTerminated</li>
    </ul>
    <li>types <code>r</code> and <code>rd</code>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><code>entry_date_filed</code> (in type <code>r</code> is available in documents nested within the <code>recap_documents key</code>)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>type <code>o</code>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>dateArgued</li>
      <li>dateFiled</li>
      <li>dateReargued</li>
      <li>dateReargumentDenied</li>
    </ul>
    <li>type <code>oa</code>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>dateArgued</li>
      <li>dateReargued</li>
      <li>dateReargumentDenied</li>
    </ul>
    <li>type <code>p</code>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>dob</li>
      <li>dod</li>
      <li>The following fields are available within the nested <code>positions</code> key:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>date_confirmation</li>
        <li>date_elected</li>
        <li>date_hearing</li>
        <li>date_judicial_committee_action</li>
        <li>date_nominated</li>
        <li>date_recess_appointment</li>
        <li>date_referred_to_judicial_committee</li>
        <li>date_retirement</li>
        <li>date_start</li>
        <li>date_termination</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-no-random-sorting">No more random sorting</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You can no longer sort the results randomly. This was only used by developers and was difficult to support.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-stemming-synonyms">Stemming and Synonyms</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide better relevancy, stemming and synonyms are disabled on the <code>caseName</code> fields.
    </li>
    <li>This is because broadening a query to include synonyms and other words with the same stem are not relevant when a user searches for a case by name.
      For example, when searching for a case name that includes the word "Howells" results for a search on the word "Howell" would not be relevant.
    </li>
    <li>This change applies to both the <code>case_name</code> filter and the text query.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-get-params">Changes to GET parameters</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>When searching the case law status fields, the GET parameters have been changed as follows:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>stat_Precedential → stat_Published</li>
      <li>stat_Non-Precedential → stat_Unpublished</li>
      <li>stat_Errata → stat_Errata</li>
      <li>stat_Separate Opinion → stat_Separate</li>
      <li>stat_In-chambers → stat_In-chambers</li>
      <li>stat_Relating-to orders → stat_Relating-to</li>
      <li>stat_Unknown Status → stat_Unknown</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-400-error">Bad Request Error Code: 400</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The error can contain one of the following custom messages in the <code>detail</code>key, explaining the reason for the error:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The query contains unbalanced parentheses.</li>
      <li>The query contains unbalanced quotes.</li>
      <li>The query contains an unrecognized proximity token.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-500-error">Server Error Code: 500</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Any other error, such as a connection error or a parsing error of the ES query, will raise <code>Server Error</code> Code: <code>500</code>.</li>
    <li>And the message in the detail key: <code>Internal Server Error. Please try again later or review your query.</code></li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="backwards-404-error">Not Found Error Code: 404</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>In the V4 Search API or other V4 database-based endpoints using cursor pagination, the following error can be raised: <code>Not Found Error</code> Code: <code>404</code>
    </li>
    <li>Message in the <code>detail</code> key: <code>Invalid cursor</code>
    </li>
    <li>This can happen if the cursor was modified manually or if the ordering key changed and doesn't match the ordering key in the cursor.
    </li>
    <li>To avoid this problem, when changing the sorting key, restart your request by removing the cursor key from your request.
    </li>
  </ul>
