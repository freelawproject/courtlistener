        <h2 id="about">REST API &ndash; V2</h2>
        <p>For developers that wish to have a more granular API for our data, we provide a RESTful API
            based on the <a href="http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">tastypie toolkit</a>.
        </p>
        <p>This API currently has nine endpoints that can be consumed via GET requests:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="/api/rest/v2/docket/">/api/rest/v2/docket/</a></li>
            <li><a href="/api/rest/v2/audio/">/api/rest/v2/audio/</a></li>
            <li><a href="/api/rest/v2/document/">/api/rest/v2/document/</a></li>
            <li><a href="/api/rest/v2/cites/">/api/rest/v2/cites/</a></li>
            <li><a href="/api/rest/v2/cited-by/">/api/rest/v2/cited-by/</a></li>
            <li><a href="/api/rest/v2/citation/">/api/rest/v2/citation/</a></li>
            <li><a href="/api/rest/v2/jurisdiction/">/api/rest/v2/jurisdiction/</a></li>
            <li><a href="/api/rest/v2/search/">/api/rest/v2/search/</a></li>
            <li><a href="{% url "coverage_api" version="2" court="all" %}">{% url "coverage_api" version="2" court="all" %}</a></li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            These endpoints can be used in combination to make sophisticated
            queries against our database or our search engine and are
            described in detail below. With the exception of the coverage
            endpoint, each of these have schema documents associated with them
            that can be found by appending "schema" to their location (e.g.
            <a href="/api/rest/v2/document/schema/">/api/rest/v2/document/schema/</a>).
        </p>
        <p>The following representation of our database should be instructive
            when thinking about how these endpoints work together:
        </p>
        <img src="{{ STATIC_PREFIX }}png/schema-design.png" height="276" width="470" class="img-responsive">

        <p class="alt">(A more detailed version of this diagram <a
                href="http://lists.freelawproject.org/pipermail/dev/2014-September/000084.html">was
            posted to our developer mailing list</a>.)
        </p>

        <p>The basic ideas are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each Audio file and each Document are associated with a Docket,
                and each Docket can have many Documents or Audio files
                associated with it (sometimes thousands).
            </li>
            <li>Each Docket is associated with a single jurisdiction.
                Generally, this is the court where the dispute was litigated.
                If the case moves between jurisdictions, each jurisdiction has
                its own docket.
            </li>
            <li>Each Document, if it is an Opinion, has an associated Citation
                object.
            </li>
            <li>Different Documents cite different Citations, forming a many to
                many relationship (cases_cited).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Overview of Endpoints</h3>
        <p>
            This section explains general principles of the API and rules that apply to all of our RESTful endpoints.
        </p>



        <h4>Authentication</h4>
        <p>
            With the exception of the coverage endpoint, all of the endpoints use either
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic Authentication</a> or
            Django Session Authentication. To use the API, you must therefore either be logged into the CourtListener
            website (Session Authentication) or you must use your CourtListener credentials to set up HTTP Basic
            Authentication. Both of these authentication mechanisms protect your credentials on the wire via HTTPS.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do HTTP Basic Authentication using cURL, you might do something like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl --user "harvey:your-password" "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/document/"</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            You can also do it in your browser with a url like:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>https://harvey:your-password@www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/document/</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            But that's not normally necessary because most browsers will provide you with a popup if you need to
            authenticate using HTTP Basic Authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Authentication is necessary so we can monitor usage of the system and so we can assist with any errors that
            may occur. Per our <a href="/terms/#privacy">privacy policy</a>, we do not track your queries in the API,
            though we may collect statistical information for system monitoring.
        </p>



        <h4>Serialization Formats</h4>
        <p>
            With the exception of the coverage endpoint (which is only available as JSON), requests may be serialized
            as JSON, JSONP, or XML, with JSON as the default. The format you wish to receive may be requested via the
            HTTP <code>Accept</code> header or via the <code>format</code> GET parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that because your browser prioritizes <code>application/xml</code> over <code>application/json</code>,
            you'll always receive XML when using your browser to explore our APIs. If you wish to override this, you
            may wish to use a less opinionated way of GETting resources such as cURL or you can override it using the
            <code>format</code> GET parameter, like so:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/document/?<strong>format=json</strong></code>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            If you wish to receive XML via a tool such as cURL, set the Accept header manually, like so:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl <strong>-H "Accept: application/xml"</strong> https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/document/</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Or again, you can use the <code>format</code> GET parameter:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/document/?<strong>format=xml</strong></code>
        </blockquote>



        <h4>Views, Pagination and Subset Selection</h4>
        <p>
            Each endpoint provides a list view, a detail view and a set view. The <em>list</em> view is what you see
            when you visit an endpoint, when it shows a list of results.  The <em>detail</em> view shows all meta
            data for a single result and can be viewed by following the <code>resource_uri</code> field for a result on
            the list view. Occasionally, content is excluded from the list view for performance reasons, but it may be
            available on the detail view. With the exception of the coverage API, links to the next and previous pages
            are available in the <code>meta</code> section of the results.
        </p>
        <p>
            A subset of results may be selected by using the <em>set</em> view, and separating the IDs you wish to
            receive with semi-colons. For example this returns three jurisdictions using the <code>jurisdiction</code>
            endpoint:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/jurisdiction/set/scotus;ca9;cal"</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Note that we use quotation marks in this query in order to escape shell interpretation of the semicolons.
        </p>



        <h4>Filtering</h4>
        <p>
            With the exception of the coverage endpoint, each endpoint can be filtered in various ways, as
            defined in their schema (available at <code>/api/rest/v2/$endpoint/schema/</code>). In the schemas you will
            find rules defining how each field can be filtered. These correspond to the
            <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups">field lookups in the
            Django Queryset API</a>. If a field has <code>1</code> as its available rule, that indicates that
            <em>all</em> Django Queryset field lookups are available on that field.
        </p>
        <p>
            Field lookups can be used by appending them to a field with a double underscore as a separator (examples
            are below in the documentation for various endpoints).
        </p>



        <h4>Ordering</h4>
        <p>
            With the exception of the coverage endpoint, ordering can be done on fields defined in the <em>ordering</em>
            section of an endpoint's schema. Ordering is done using the <code>order_by</code> GET parameter, with
            descending ordering available by prepending the minus sign (e.g. <code>order_by=-date_modified</code>).
            However, because the <em>search</em> endpoint uses Solr for its backend, ordering is instead done using
            the <code>asc</code> and <code>desc</code>, as described in detail below. This allows the URLs used for
            the search endpoint to match those used in front-end queries.
        </p>



        <h4>Field Selection</h4>
        <p>
            To save bandwidth and speed up your queries, fields can be limited by using the <code>fields</code> GET
            parameter with a comma-separated list of fields you wish to receive.
        </p>
        <p>For example, if you wish to only receive the <code>resource_uri</code> and <code>absolute_url</code>
            fields from the <code>document</code> endpoint you could do so with:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/document/?<strong>fields=absolute_url,resource_uri</strong></code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Using the double underscore syntax, this can also be used for nested resources. For example, the
            <code>document</code> endpoint nests the <code>citation</code> endpoint in its results and the
            <code>citation</code> endpoint has a field called <code>federal_cite_one</code>. If you wished to use the
            <code>document</code> endpoint to only get back the nested <code>federal_cite_one</code> field, you could do
            so with:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/document/?<strong>fields=citation__federal_cite_one</strong></code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Using the <code>fields</code> parameter in these ways could save
            both of us time and bandwidth if you are making many requests.
            Please consider using this parameter for your requests.
        </p>



        <h4>Limitations</h4>
        <p>
            At present, this API is throttled to 1,000 queries per endpoint per user per hour, while we learn where our
            performance bottlenecks are. If you are hitting this limit or anticipate doing so, please get in touch so
            we can investigate easing your thresholds.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the list view, 20 results are shown at a time by default. This can be limited to show fewer results, but
            cannot be set to show more. The <code>jurisdiction</code> endpoint allows up to 1,000 results at a time by
            setting the <code>limit</code> GET parameter like so:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/jurisdiction/?<strong>limit=50</strong></code>
        </blockquote>



        <h4>Date Formats</h4>
        <p>
            As <a href="http://xkcd.com/1179/">required by influential comic
            strips</a>, all date formats are set to <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO-8601
            format</a>.
        </p>



        <h4>The <code>absolute_url</code> Field</h4>
        <p>
            The <code>absolute_url</code> field shows the URL where a resource
            can be seen live on the site. It is absolute in the sense that it
            should never change and will always be backwards compatible if
            changes are ever needed (as in the upgrade to v2 of this API).
        </p>
        <p>
            In some cases you might only have a URL, and you might want to look up the item in the API. <code>
            absolute_url</code>s generally look like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>/$document-type/$numeric-id/$name-of-the-case/</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            There are three sections:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>$document-type</strong>: This is the type of document that has been returned, for example,
                "opinion" indicates that you have gotten an opinion as your result.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>$numeric-id</strong>: This is a numeric representation of the ID for the document. This value
                increments as we add content to the system. Note that due to deletions and modifications the numeric
                IDs are not guaranteed to be purely sequential &ndash; IDs will be missing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>$name-of-the-case</strong>: This is the "<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_%28publishing%29">slug</a>"
                of the document, and generally mirrors its case name. This
                value can change if we clean up a case name, but provided it is
                not omitted completely, this part of the URL can be any value
                without ever affecting the page that is loaded. Put another
                way, we load pages based on the <code>$numeric-id</code> and
                <code>$document-type</code>, not by the name of the case.
            </li>
        </ol>



        <h4>IDs and SHA1 Sums</h4>
        <p>
            Because of the way the data is organized in our backend, there is a unique ID for each citation and each
            document. This means that when you are working with the <code>citation</code> endpoint, you cannot use the
            document IDs, and vice versa. For example, this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/<strong>document</strong>/111170/</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Returns <em><a href="/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/">Strickland v. Washington</a></em>. But this
            does not:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/<strong>citation</strong>/111170/</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Even though though they have the same ID. Each document and audio
            file also has a globally unique <code><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA1</a></code> sum
            that can be queried using the search endpoint:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/search/?q=a2daab35251795fc2621c6ac46b6031c95a4e0ba</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            To get audio results, also set the type parameter to
            <code>oa</code>, for oral arguments.
        </p>



        <h4>Upgrades and Fixes</h4>
        <p>
            Like the rest of the CourtListener platform, this API and its documentation are

        </p>



        <h3 id="document-endpoint">/api/rest/v2/document/</h3>
        <p>
            This can be considered the main endpoint for many users. It provides access to the documents in our database
            and can be filtered or ordered in various ways as mentioned above. As with all endpoints, field descriptions
            can be found in the schema document. Visiting this endpoint provides the metadata for 20 documents at a
            time. The full text of the documents may be found by visiting their detail page, which can be found by
            following the <code>resource_uri</code> attribute for a result. Full text is not provided by default to
            save on bandwidth and processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The results at this endpoint can be filtered by a number of fields. Among others, this includes filtering
            by:
        </p>
        <!-- A more clever person would generate this *from* the schema itself -->
        <ul>
            <li><code>blocked</code>: Whether the document should be blocked from search engines.</li>
            <li><code>citation_count</code>: The number of times the document has been cited by other documents.</li>
            <li><code>court</code>: The ID of the court where the document was written.</li>
            <li><code>date_filed</code>: The date the document was filed by the court.</li>
            <li><code>date_modified</code>: The date and time the document was last modified.</li>
            <li><code>extracted_by_ocr</code>: Whether the text of the document was extracted from an image using OCR.</li>
            <li><code>precedential_status</code>: Whether the document has precedential value.</li>
            <li><code>time_retrieved</code>: The date and time the document was added to our system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For the full list of filtering fields, see the <em>filtering</em>
            section of the <a
                href="/api/rest/v2/document/schema/?format=json">schema
            document</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, in the schema document you will find that each filtering field provides a list of
            field lookups that are available to it. The following query provides an example of these lookups in
            use. Observe the following query, which gets all items that were modified after June 9th, 2013
            (<code>__gt</code>), ordered by <code>date_modified</code> (ascending).
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/document/?<strong>date_modified__gt=2013-06-09+00:00Z&order_by=date_modified</strong></code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            And remember, to flip the ordering, you can use a minus sign in your ordering argument
            (<code>order_by=<strong>-</strong>date_modified</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
            The results of this endpoint can also be ordered by <code>time_retrieved</code>, <code>date_modified</code>,
            <code>date_filed</code>, or <code>date_blocked</code>. Again, this is described in more detail in the
            schema.
        </p>



        <h3 id="audio-endpoint">/api/rest/v2/audio/</h3>
        <p>
            The <code>audio</code> endpoint is modeled after the <code>document</code> endpoint and has very similar behavior, except
            instead of serving documents, it currently serves oral arguments and may later serve other similar audio files. As with the
            document endpoint, it can be filtered and ordered by various fields as described in its <a
                href="/api/rest/v2/audio/schema/?format=json">schema document</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from these few notes, the <code>audio</code> endpoint should be very familiar and should have no surprises.
        </p>



        <h3 id='cites-endpoint'>/api/rest/v2/cites/ <span class="alt bold">and</span> /api/rest/v2/cited-by/</h3>
        <p>
            These endpoints provide interfaces into the citation graph that CourtListener provides between documents.
            <code>/cites/</code> provides a paginated display of the documents that a document <em>cites</em>, and
            <code>cited-by</code> provides a paginated display of the documents that cite a document. These can be
            thought of as compliments, though the results can be dramatically different. For example, a very important
            document, <em><a href="/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/">Strickland v.
            Washington</a></em>, has been cited thousands of times (<code>cited-by</code>), however no document cites
            thousands of other documents (looking in the database, it appears the limit is around 400 authorities).
        </p>
        <p>
            These endpoints only provide limited functionality. They cannot be filtered or ordered and they do not
            provide a detail or set view. To use these endpoints, provide the ID of the document you wish to
            analyze, like so:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/cited-by/?id=111170</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Or the reverse:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/cites/?id=111170</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The <code>id</code> parameter is required.
        </p>



        <h3 id="citation-endpoint">/api/rest/v2/citation/</h3>
        <p>
            This endpoint is integrated into the <code>document</code> endpoint and is also available individually.
            This endpoint provides each of the many citations that an opinion can have. Since opinions are often included
            in several written reporters, there are fields in this model for numerous
            <a href="http://legalresearchprinciples.pbworks.com/w/page/16129937/Parallel%20Citations">parallel
            citations</a>. After several years reorganizing our schema, we currently categorize citations into the
            following types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Neutral (e.g. 2013 FL 1)</li>
            <li>Federal (e.g. 5 F. 55)</li>
            <li>State (e.g. Alabama Reports </li>
            <li>Regional (e.g. Atlantic Reporter)</li>
            <li>Specialty (e.g. Lawyers' Edition)</li>
            <li>Old Supreme Court (e.g. 5 Black. 55)</li>
            <li>Lexis or West (e.g. 5 LEXIS 55, or 5 WL 55)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Some opinions have multiple citations of a given type, and to support those instances we provide several
            fields of that type. For example, we have fields for <code>federal_cite_one</code>,
            <code>federal_cite_two</code>, and <code>federal_cite_three</code>, which together can hold three parallel
            federal citations for a single opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the filtering, ordering and field lookups described above can be used on this endpoint, as described
            in its <a href="/api/rest/v2/citation/schema/?format=json">schema</a>. This endpoint also provides a field called
            <code>opinion_uris</code>, which references the parent opinion for a citation.
        </p>
        <p>
            At present, for performance reasons it is not possible to filter based on a citation. For this purpose, we
            recommend the <a href="#search-endpoint">search endpoint</a>. For instance, when you know a citation and
            want to see what information we have about it, try something like:
            <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/search/?citation=101 U.S. 99">https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/search/?citation=101 U.S. 99</a>.
        </p>



        <h3 id="jurisdiction-endpoint">/api/rest/v2/jurisdiction/</h3>
        <p>
            This is the simplest of our REST endpoints and currently provides basic information about the
            <strong>{{ court_count }}</strong> jurisdictions in the American court system that we support.
        </p>
        <p>
            This endpoint can be filtered or ordered in numerous ways as described in its
            <a href="/api/rest/v2/jurisdiction/schema/">schema</a>. Brief descriptions of the fields can be found there
            as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time this endpoint will contain more and more information
            about jurisdictions such as the address of the courthouses and
            other such information. We welcome data contributions in this area
            as much of this information will need to be gathered manually.
        </p>



        <h3 id="search-endpoint">/api/rest/v2/search/</h3>
        <p>
            This endpoint allows you to query our search engine in a similar manner as is possible in our front end.
            Because this endpoint does not use the Django models directly, this endpoint is quite different than any
            other. Several differences should be noted.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, the fields and results from this endpoint are slightly
            different than those in the other endpoints. For example, instead
            of using a minus sign to flip ordering, it uses <code>asc</code>
            and <code>desc</code>. And instead of the <code>court</code> field
            returning a reference to the <code>jurisdiction</code> endpoint,
            it provides the name of the jurisdiction where the document was
            issued. (See <a href="/api/rest/v2/search/schema/?format=json">the
            schema</a> and the notes below for all of the ordering options
            and field information).
        </p>
        <p>
            A peculiarity of this endpoint is that, like the front end, it serves both <code>audio</code> and
            <code>document</code> results, depending on the value of the <code>type</code> argument. These results have
            many overlapping fields, so, for example, if you get back the field <code>download_url</code> and the
            <code>type</code> is set to the letter <code>o</code> (meaning opinions)&hellip;
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/search/?<strong>type=o</strong></code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            &hellip;<code>download_url</code> will represent the location the
            opinion was downloaded from. Conversely, if <code>type</code> is
            set to the letters <code>oa</code> (meaning oral arguments), the
            <code>download_url</code> will represent the location the <em>audio
            file</em> was downloaded from, instead. This can be confusing,
            however, remember that the <code>type</code> field defaults to
            <code>o</code>, and that the fields that overlap should make sense
            for all result types.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because this endpoint hits against a Solr search index instead of a
            database, the filtering works differently. To filter on this
            endpoint, we recommend identifying an effective query on the front
            end that generates the results you desire and then using that query
            (and variations thereof) to query the API. On the backend, the same
            code serves both the API and the front end.
        </p>
        <p>
            When examining the <em>filtering</em> section of <a
                href="/api/rest/v2/search/schema/?format=json">the schema</a>,
            note that fields have been labeled as follows:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>search</dt>
            <dd>
                These fields are filterable according to the syntax defined in the
                <a href="{% url 'advanced_search' %}">advanced query techniques</a> available on the front end.
            </dd>
            <dt>int</dt>
            <dd>
                These fields require ints as their arguments, and generally provide greater-than or less-than
                queries
            </dd>
            <dt>date</dt>
            <dd>
                These fields allow you to search for dates greater than or less than a given value. Input dates ascribe
                to ISO-8601 format, however, partial dates are allowed, and will be interpreted appropriately. For
                example, placing "2012" in the <code>filed_after</code> parameter will assume you mean documents after
                "2012-01-01".
            </dd>
            <dt>Boolean</dt>
            <dd>
                Only the stat_* field is currently available as boolean. This field is represented by checkboxes in
                the front end, and can be enabled by setting its value to "on". For example to include only
                Precedential documents, you might place a query like:
                <blockquote>
                    <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/search/?<strong>stat_Precedential=on</strong></code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
            <dt>CSV</dt>
            <dd>
                The <code>court</code> field is currently available as a list of comma separated values (CSV). Thus, to
                request multiple courts, you can simply separate their IDs with a comma. For example to get all
                documents from the Supreme Court (<code>scotus</code>) and the Ninth Circuit of Appeals
                (<code>ca9</code>), you would make a query like:
                <blockquote>
                    <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/search/?<strong>court=scotus,ca9</strong></code>
                </blockquote>
                IDs for all jurisdictions are in the sidebar.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Finally, note that like the front end, when the <code>type</code> is set to <code>o</code> (the default), only
            precedential results are returned by default. See below for an example that also returns non-precedential results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Four fields in the search results require special explanation:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>resource_uri</code></dt>
            <dd>
                Because this endpoint is designed to help find documents, once you've found the ones you want, we provide
                a <code>resource_uri</code> that directs you back to the <code>document</code> endpoint, which has all of
                the best meta data. This is in contrast to any of the other endpoints, but follows the pattern of searching
                for results and selecting them to examine the details.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>snippet</code></dt>
            <dd>
                This field contains the same values as are found on the front end, utilizing the HTML5
                <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> element to identify up to five matches in an document. If you wish to use the
                snippet but do not want highlighting, simply use CSS to give the <code>mark</code> element no styling,
                like a <code>span</code> element. This field only responds to arguments provided to the <code>q</code>
                parameter. If that parameter is not used, the <code>snippet</code> field will show the first 500
                characters of the <code>text</code> field.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>stat_*</code></dt>
            <dd>
                For this Boolean field, we provide opinionated default values. Because most searchers are not interested
                in non-precedential (unpublished) results, we leave them out by default. If you wish to receive these
                items, you must explicitly ask for them as you do on the front end. For example, this query returns both
                precedential (published) and non-precedential (unpublished) results:
                <blockquote>
                    <code>curl https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v2/search/?stat_Precedential=on&stat_Non-Precedential=on</code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
            <dt><code>court</code></dt>
            <dd>
                This field provides the name of the jurisdiction where the document was issued. In other endpoints, this
                field directs you to the <code>jurisdiction</code> endpoint.
            </dd>
        </dl>



        <h3 id="coverage-endpoint">/api/rest/v2/coverage/</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike the other endpoints in this API, the coverage endpoint is
            not based on the <a
                href="http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">tastypie
            API framework</a>. As a result it is much simpler, only providing
            data in a very specific manner, serialized as JSON. In the future
            we expect to expand this API to provide faceting along additional
            fields, but at present it simply provides jurisdiction counts by
            year for any requested jurisdiction. This API does not require
            authentication and is what powers our live <a href="/coverage/">coverage page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To receive jurisdiction counts by year, simply provide the
            jurisdiction ID you wish to query or the special keyword,
            <code>all</code>, which returns counts for all jurisdictions. For
            example, this provides annual counts for the Ninth Circuit of
            Appeals (<code>ca9</code>):
        </p>
