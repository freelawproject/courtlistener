  <h1 id="about">PACER Data&nbsp;APIs</h1>
  <p class="lead">Use these APIs to access almost half a billion items we have in our collection of PACER data.
  </p>
  <p>To learn more about what's in the collection and how we gather PACER data each day, see <a href="{% url "coverage_recap" %}">our coverage page on the topic</a>.
  </p>
  <p>This data is organized into a number of objects. An overview of these objects is described in this section, and greater detail is provided for each, below.
  </p>
  <p>In any legal proceeding, there are roughly three things: Documents, people, and organizations. Documents are grouped together into docket entries, which are grouped together into dockets. People and organizations are examples of parties. Parties have attorneys who act on their behalf in particular ways, which we call the attorney's role in the case.
  </p>
  <p>Each of these relationships is interlinked and has metadata that describes it. Use these APIs to explore this data.
  </p>

  <h2 id="apis">Dockets, Courts, Docket Entries, and&nbsp;Documents</h2>
  <p>A docket is a list of docket entries and some metadata. Each docket entry is a collection of documents that is uploaded to the court by a party or their attorney at a given time.
  </p>
  <p>The endpoints described in this section explain these objects and how they can be accessed in our system.
  </p>


  <h3 id="docket-endpoint">Dockets <small> — <code>{% url "docket-list" version=version %}</code></small></h3>
  {% include "includes/docket-endpoint.html" %}
  <p>Ideally, docket entries, parties, and attorneys would be nested within the docket object you request, but this is not possible because some dockets have a vast number of these objects. Listing so many values in a single response from the server is impractical. To access docket entries, parties, or attorneys for a specific docket, use the docket entry, party, or attorney endpoints and filter by docket ID.
  </p>
  <p>The court fields are references to our Court API, described below.</p>


  <h3 id="court-endpoint">Courts <small> — <code>{% url "court-list" version=version %}</code></small></h3>
  {% include "includes/court-endpoint.html" %}


  <h3 id="docket-entry-endpoint">Docket Entries <small> — <code>{% url "docketentry-list" version=version %}</code></small></h3>
  <p><code>Docket Entry</code> objects represent the rows on a PACER docket, and contain one or more nested documents. This follows the design on PACER, in which a single row on a docket represents a document with its associated attachments.
  </p>
  <p>To look up field descriptions or options for filtering, ordering, or rendering, complete an HTTP <code>OPTIONS</code> request.
  </p>
  <p>To filter to the docket entries for a particular docket use the <code>docket</code>filter:
  </p>
  <pre class="pre-scrollable">curl -v \
  --header 'Authorization: Token {% if user.is_authenticated %}{{ user.auth_token }}{% else %}&lt;your-token-here&gt;{% endif %}' \
  "{% get_full_host %}{% url "docketentry-list" version=version %}?docket=4214664"</pre>
  <p>Such a request will return up to 20 docket entries per page. Each docket entry returned can contain a number of nested documents in the <code>recap_document</code> key, including their full extracted text (see details in the next section below). As a result, this response can be quite large.
  </p>
  <p>A few field-level notes:</p>
  <table class="table">

      <td>Use the RECAP sequence number to sort dockets in your system. It is based on the PACER sequence number when we have it, plus some heuristics to order content as accurately as possible. In rare cases, docket entry numbers are not sequential, and these fields are preferred.

  <p>Each docket entry contains several documents, which we call <code>RECAP Document</code> objects.

  <h2 id="party-endpoint">Parties <small> — <code>{% url "party-list" version=version %}</code></small></h2>
  <p>The <code>Party</code> endpoint provides details about parties that have been involved in federal cases in PACER, and contains nested attorney information.
  </p>
  <p>To look up field descriptions or options for filtering, ordering, or rendering, complete an HTTP <code>OPTIONS</code> request.
  </p>
  <p>This API can be filtered by docket ID to show all the parties for a particular case.
  </p>
  <p class="alert alert-warning"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> <strong>Listen Up:</strong> Filters apply to this endpoint, not the data nested within it. Therefore, each party returned by this API will list all the attorneys that have represented them in any case, even if the parties themselves are filtered to a particular case.
  </p>
  <p>For example, this query returns the parties for docket number <code>123</code>:</p>
  <pre class="pre-scrollable">curl -v \

  <h2 id="og-court-info-endpoint">Originating Court <small> — <code><nobr>{% url 'originatingcourtinformation-list' version=version %}</nobr></code></small></h2>
  <p><code>Originating Court Information</code> represents the information gathered at an appellate court about a case when it was in a lower court or administrative body.

  <p>The information in this table is joined via a one-to-one relationship to the <code>Docket</code> object. Generally, this table is only completed for appellate cases that we acquire from PACER.
