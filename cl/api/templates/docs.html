<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-8">
  <p>We currently have two types of APIs available to developers using our platform. If you are interested in obtaining large quantities of our data, we recommend using our <a href="{% url "bulk_data_index" %}">bulk API</a>, which provides compressed JSON files of our entire collection, by object type and jurisdiction. If you wish to query our data programatically, we recommend using our <a href="{% url "rest_docs" %}">REST APIs</a>.
  </p>
  <p>We also offer <a href="https://free.law/data-consulting/">custom data services</a> and custom bulk file creation, with hourly and project-based rates.
  </p>
  <p>We make these APIs available to the public according to means-based pricing so that a variety of researchers and organizations can access this information. If you are a researcher, individual, or journalist, we do not typically charge for access to these APIs. If you are a law firm or other for-profit organization, we try to identify a price point that is fair to everybody. The goal of these charges is to provide ongoing support for these APIs and for <a href="https://free.law">Free Law Project</a>, the non-profit supporting CourtListener and RECAP. We hope you'll agree that that is an important cause.
  </p>
  <p>Organizations that support Free Law Project typically do so through monthly subscriptions or one time contributions, according to what makes sense for the organization and the project.

      <h2 id="pride">We're Proud of our Data</h2>
      <p>Over the past several years, we have made a significant investment in making our data the best on the open Web. Among the minor enhancements we make on a regular basis, we've made significant improvements to our data that you won't find in other sources:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>We've <a href="https://free.law/2011/05/25/updated-supreme-court-case-dates-and-the-first-release-of-early-scotus-data-in-machine-readable-form/">
            added exact dates from the library of congress</a> to our collection
            of older Supreme Court cases, enhancing thousands of cases beyond what's
            available anywhere else.
        </li>
        <li>When we imported the Resource.org data, we <a href="https://free.law/2011/08/25/second-series-of-federal-reporter-from-1950-to-1993-now-on-courtlistener/">
            manually corrected</a> more than ten thousand omissions or
            errors in the data, ensuring that it's complete and accurate.
        </li>
        <li>Our data has <a href="https://free.law/2012/05/11/building-a-citator-on-courtlistener/">
            the citation network</a>, showing which cases reference each
            other, saving you the effort of building and testing a citation
            finding and matching algorithm yourself.
        </li>
        <li>We complete complicated cleanup routines on the data, eliminating and
            fixing errant abbreviations like 'et al', 'U.S.A.' and the like.
        </li>
        <li>The data on CourtListener is a combination of many partial sources such
            as court websites, <a href="https://public.resource.org/">Public.Resource.Org</a>,
            and a donation from <a href="http://lawboxapps.com">Lawbox LLC.</a>
            This means that we have the best parts of all of our sources.
        </li>
        <li>We help identify opinions that should be private. Many people don't want their case on the Web and have contacted us. In our data we provide a field indicating which cases should be kept private. In addition, we provide research about how to keep these cases out of search engines (more detail at right).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can learn more about the data that we have on our <a href="{% url "coverage" %}">coverage page</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy of Court Materials</h2>
      <p>As is <a href="{% url "terms" %}#removal">explained in our removal policy</a>, we have blocked public search engines from indexing many of the cases available in our data. We do this through a combination of automatic and manual procedures.
      </p>
      <p>As you work with this data, it is essential that you be cognizant of the privacy and safety issues involved with legal documents. This impacts real people with real privacy concerns. This includes jailed confidential informants, the victims of stalkers, foreign citizens with rejected asylum requests, children who were named incidentally in a case about their parent's wrongdoings, exhonorated individuals, and the list goes on.
      </p>

      <p>If you intend to use this data on the Internet, carefully consider how you will protect these people and respect the privacy wishes of the parties involved. Please read our privacy policy for our approach to this problem and identify the "<code>blocked</code>" field in each case. This field  describes whether we have blocked search engines from indexing the case. The simple thing for you to do is to also block such cases.
      </p>

      <p>Please also note that robots.txt is a wholly insufficient way to block court documents from search engines. For a better technical approach, please see the blog entries below.
