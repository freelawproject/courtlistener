    <p class="lead">The CourtListener Database Replication service is for researchers and organizations that need high-speed, granular access to the CourtListener database on an ongoing basis.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-info">This service is currently in beta. If you wish to learn more about this service or apply to join the beta program, please <a href="{% url "contact" %}">get in touch</a> to discuss getting started.
    </p>
    <p>This service works by using PostgreSQL to create and maintain a table-based <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/logical-replication.html">logical replica</a> of our database to a server that you control. Once the replica has completed its first sync, you can query your replica of the CourtListener database using standard SQL commands. This provides an incredibly powerful way to access one of the largest open collections of American legal data.
    </p>
    <p>The following types of data are currently available as part of this service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Opinions</p></li>
      <li><p>RECAP Archive of PACER data</p></li>
      <li><p>Oral Arguments</p></li>
      <li><p>Judge and Appointer data</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>User data will never be shared as part of this service.
    </p>
    <p>Setting up this service is complicated. You will need to create a dedicated server that can support the kinds of data syncing requirements that a large active server like ours demands. We currently make hundreds of thousands changes or additions per day to tables with tens of millions of rows. As these commands occur on our server, they will be streamed to yours as well, keeping yours perfectly in sync, nearly instantly.
    </p>
    <p>If you are interested in this service, please get in touch to learn more. We will be happy to discuss the technical details.

    <h2>How Logical Replication Works</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/logical-replication.html">Logical replication</a> is a system supported by recent versions of PostgreSQL. Unlike older methods of database replication, which worked by shipping the database binary files across the network (so&#8209;called physical replication), logical replication works by streaming SQL commands from a "publisher" server to a "subscriber" server.
    </p>
    <p>This form of replication provides a number of benefits over physical replication including the ability to have slightly different versions of the database installed, and the ability to only replicate certain tables from the publisher to the subscriber.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Our Process</h2>
    <p>When we engage with you to set up logical replication, you will begin by creating a server in your private cloud that has a compatible version of PostgreSQL installed. This server can be set up in AWS or similar cloud providers if their version of PostgreSQL supports logical replication. This server will need sufficient drive space to hold the tables we plan to replicate, and will need sufficient memory and compute resources to support the level of traffic we expect.
    </p>
    <p>Once that server is set up, we will provide a PostgreSQL PUBLICATION for you on our server. You will subscribe to it, and the data will begin copying over until your server is synced. Once the first sync is complete, ongoing changes will be streamed to your server as they occur on CourtListener.
    </p>
    <p>Your server will always be in sync. You can query and scale it however you please.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>What about schema changes?</h3>
    <p>Logical replication allows for some schema differences between the publisher and the subscriber, but, in general, the less you change your schema, the better.
    </p>
    <p>On our end, when we make schema changes, we will inform you and you will need to make them in order to continue receiving replicated data. As you might expect, replication will fail if the schemas are not sufficiently similar on both servers.
    </p>
    <p>We will provide SQL scripts for you to run whenever schema changes are needed.
    </p>

    <h3>What if my server goes down?</h3>
    <p>Whenever your server goes down, ours will keep track of changes until yours comes back online. As soon as your server is back and the subscription is re-established, all changes from your downtime will be synced to your server.
    </p>
    <p>If you plan to take your server offline for an extended period of time, we need to know so that we can make a decision together as to whether to keep a log of all changes that occurred during your planned downtime. Keeping these changes takes up space on our hard drive.
    </p>
    <h3>More Questions?</h3>
    <p>If you have more questions, please send us an email. This service is a complicated one and we look forward to working with organizations and researchers to make it a success.
