<li><strong>People</strong>: These are the central unit of this data. In
    earlier (unreleased) versions, these were limited to only judges, but we
    discovered that it is important to also keep track of appointors such as
    governors or presidents, so they are included in this data as well. In
    these items you will find references to the other bulk data files.
</li>
<li><strong>Positions</strong>: These are the second largest part of this
    data. In the bulk positions data, you can find all of the positions that
    a Person held, including their time as president, in private practice,
    as a judge, or in any number of other roles. You will also find about a
    dozen dates tracking their nomination to the role, their date of
    appointment, how the voting process went, etc. Again, see the REST API
    for field-level details.
</li>
<li><strong>Retention Events</strong>: These are the events that keep a
    judge in a Position, such as a retention vote, or reappointment.
</li>
<li><strong>Political Affiliations</strong>: These are the political
    affiliations that a Person may have. Political affiliations are gathered
    from a number of sources such as ballots or appointments, and can have
    an associated start and end time.
</li>
<li><strong>Educations & Schools</strong>: A Person can have several
    Educations associated with them, and Educations list the Schools that a
    Person received a degree from. For example, a Person might have a B.A.
    from Harvard in 1998.
