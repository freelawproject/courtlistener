  <p><strong>People</strong> &mdash; <code>{% url "person-list" version="v3" %}</code></p>
  <p>These are the central unit of this data. In earlier (unreleased) versions, these were limited to only judges, but we discovered that it is important to also keep track of appointors such as governors or presidents, so they are included in this data as well. In these items you will find references to the other bulk data files.

</li>
<li><p><strong>Positions</strong> &mdash; <code>{% url "position-list" version="v3" %}</code></p>
  <p>These are the second largest part of this data. In the bulk positions data, you can find all of the positions that a Person held, including their time as president, in private practice, as a judge, or in any number of other roles. You will also find about a dozen dates tracking their nomination to the role, their date of appointment, how the voting process went, etc. Again, see the REST API for field-level details.
