    There are different soft bounce subtypes: General, MailboxFull
    MessageTooLarge, ContentRejected and AttachmentRejected, we perform
    different actions for each type:
    For Undetermined, General and MailboxFull: create or update a backoff
    event that works as follows:
    The general idea is to consider an average max retry period of 5 days, the
    exact period will depend on how fast SES sends bounce notifications.

    The first time we get a new soft bounce notification for an email address
    we'll wait 2 hours before trying to send another message to the same
    email address.

    If after sending a new message we get another soft bounce notification for
    the same email address the next waiting period will be 4 hours,
    if continue bouncing the next waiting period will be 8, 16, 32, and 64
    hours in the 5ยบ retry, for a total of 126 hours (in average 5.25 days)
    since the initial bounce, if we receive another bounce notification
    after the 5ยบ retry, the email address is banned.

    For: MessageTooLarge, AttachmentRejected, we create a small_email_only
    flag for the email address in order to avoid sending attachments to this
    email address in the future and then we try to resend the
    small_email_only email version.

    For unexpected bounce types, like: ContentRejected, we log a warning.
