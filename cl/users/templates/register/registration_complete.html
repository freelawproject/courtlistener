    <ul>
      <li><p>Is the email address above correct? If not, please register again.</p></li>
      <li><p>Check your spam folder. Because we send a lot of alert emails, we sometimes get wrongly categorized as a spammer. If the email is in your spam folder, please mark the message as <strong>NOT SPAM</strong> and add <code>{{ default_from }}</code> to your contacts.</p>

      <li><p>If it's not in your spam folder, you may <a href="{% url "email_confirmation_request" %}">request another confirmation email</a> from us. This can sometimes help if the email gets lost in transit.</p>
