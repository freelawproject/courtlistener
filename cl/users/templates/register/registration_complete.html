    <h3>Welcome to CourtListener!</h3>
    <p>We have sent you an email to confirm your email address. To log in, please click the link in that email within five days. That will confirm your account.
    </p>
    <p>If you do not receive the confirmation email:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Check your spam folder. Because we send a lot of alert emails, we sometimes get wrongly categorized as a spammer. If the email is in your spam folder, please add <code>{{ default_from }}</code> to your contacts.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>If it's not in your spam folder, you may <a href="{% url "email_confirmation_request" %}">request another confirmation email</a> from us. This can sometimes help if the email gets lost in transit.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are still unable to confirm your email address, please <a href="{% url "contact" %}">contact us for assistance</a>. We are always happy to help.
