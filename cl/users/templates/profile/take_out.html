      <p>We believe that our users have a general right to access their data and to export it from CourtListener.
      </p>
      <p>To create an export request, please press the button below, and we will generate a file with your data and email it to the address that is associated with your account.
      </p>
      <p>Typically, export files will include things like your favorites, alerts, and visualizations.
      </p>
      <p>Generating exports typically takes 2&dash;5 days. If you delete your account during this time, we will not be able to generate your export.</p>
