A new user signed up for CourtListener and we tried to match their email address
to Neon. Alas, it didn't work because the email address '{{ user.email }}' appears
is in Neon more than once.

Please take the following actions to fix this situation:

1. Please review the "Partial Match Queue" in Neon, as documented here:

    https://support.neonone.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407408776717-Account-Match-Queue

In that queue, you should find this user and you should be able to merge their records.

2. Once that's completed, please add the Neon account ID of the merged record to
CourtListener at the following link:

    https://www.courtlistener.com/admin/user/{{ user.id }}

Thank you for keeping everything tidy and good!
