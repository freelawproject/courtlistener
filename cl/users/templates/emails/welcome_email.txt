Hello{% if name %} {{ name }}{% endif %},

I'm Mike, one of the co-founders of Free Law Project, the non-profit that
builds and maintains CourtListener, RECAP, and Bots.law. This is an automated
message, but I like to send it anyway just to say hello and to welcome you to
the site. Welcome!

Whether you're here to monitor cases, do research, download our data, or even
contribute somehow to our efforts, I'm glad you've signed up and would be happy
to help you with whatever you're trying to do.

Some of the highlights of CourtListener and RECAP are:

 - A searchable case law archive with high-quality metadata and citations:

 - The RECAP Archive, which has over 200M pages of PACER content and over 60M
   federal cases:

       https://www.courtlistener.com{% url "advanced_r" %}

 - The RECAP Extension for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Safari, which helps make
   PACER better and cheaper, while contributing to the RECAP Archive:

 - Our oral argument audio archive, containing over three million minutes of
   recordings:

As a non-profit, everything we do here is open source, and we always do our
best to share everything we can with the public. If you like our work, we would
love your support in the form of a donation:

Every bit helps us do more.

You've got my email address now. Let me know if you can't figure something out
or if you have a suggestion on how things could be better. I hope you enjoy
using CourtListener, RECAP, and all our services!
