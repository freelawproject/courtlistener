Hello{% if name %} {{ name }}{% endif %},

I'm Mike, one of the co-founders of Free Law Project, the non-profit that
sponsors the development of CourtListener and RECAP. This is an automated
message, but I like to send it anyway just to say hello and to welcome you to
the site. Welcome!

Whether you'd just like to set up some daily alerts for topics that interest
you, download our data, or even contribute somehow to our efforts, I'm glad
you've signed up and would be happy to try to help you with whatever you're
trying to do.

Some of the highlights of CourtListener and RECAP are:

 - A searchable archive of opinions with high quality metadata and citations:

 - The RECAP Archive, one of the largest open collections of federal court
   data:

       https://www.courtlistener.com{% url "advanced_r" %}

 - The RECAP Extension for Firefox and Chrome, which helps make PACER better
   and cheaper, while contributing to the RECAP Archive:

 - Our oral argument audio archive, containing over a million minutes of
   recordings:

As a non-profit, everything we do here is open source, and we always do our
best to share everything we can with the public. If you like our work, we would
love your support in the form of a donation:

Every bit helps us do more.

You've got my email address now. Let me know if you can't figure something out
or if you have a suggestion on how things could be better. I hope you enjoy
using CourtListener, RECAP, and all our services!
