"""
This module contains the clustering algorithm for grouping
parentheticals of a case into groups of textually-similar parentheticals.

The basic idea here is that many cases are summarized in parentheticals by other
cases repeatedly in similar or even identical ways. We want to identify and group
those similar parentheticals so that we can (a) not show the user repetitive
information in the limited space we have and (b) identify which ideas are most
often described so that we can rank them higher in the results.

The main outward-facing function is :get_parenthetical_groups, which takes in
a list of Parenthetical objects and returns a list of ComputedParentheticalGroup
objects containing those parentheticals and certain metadata about the groups.

Implementation-wise, we are doing an approximation of Jaccard similarity
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) between the tokens of every
parenthetical and every other and group together those parentheticals that
are above a certain threshold of similarity to each other. To do this
efficiently, we make use of the datasketch library's implementation of MinHash,
an algorithm known as a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm.

For information about MinHash, here are a couple of good resources:
https://medium.com/@jonathankoren/near-duplicate-detection-b6694e807f7a
http://ekzhu.com/datasketch/lsh.html

A detailed explanation of the implementation and motivation for this algorithm
can be found in the following issue and pull request:
