PART II

Only case_name_full in part II.  Ignore the remaining text

Once complete, you are to take the case name full extracted above and normalize the full case name using the following rules.

Your job is to normalize the full case name provided into a blue book style short case name.

You must think thru each step of shortening step-by-step.  Double check your work and make sure each rule is satisfied.

YOU MUST INVOKE chain-of-thought


1. Return shortened case name
    •    You must return a shorteneded case name
    •	`case_name`: The blue book formatted short case name.
        • Use Bluebook case-name formatting. Given a case caption, return the properly shortened case name(s) according to the following rules:
            •	Surname: Use only the surname of individuals. Delete given names and initials, unless
                    (a) the initials come at the end of the name ex. (James C.),
                    (b) it is part of a business name, or
                    (c) the court has abbreviated the surname (e.g., minors).
                • Surnames should never be abbreviated to a single letter.  For Example if a case Abbreviates the Surname, include the first name and abbreviated surname
                    * For Example:
                         `Jimmy C. v. Adam Smith, Acting Commissioner of United Nations` - Should reduce to `Jimmy C. v. Smith`
                •	When multiple surnames are present (for example in common spanish names) , reduce to the last surname.  Do not use spanish style
                    * For Example:
                        Ana Maria Garcia Lopez should be shortened to Lopez.
                        Always use the final surname of a party and not the middle name
                        Double check this work
                    * when deciding which surname to use, pick the last one.
                    • if the last is a hyphenated block, keep the entire hyphenation.
            •	First-named party rule: Only include the first-listed party on each side of the "v." Do not use "et al."
            •	Common abbreviations: Use common acronyms (e.g., SEC, ACLU, NASA, FBI).
            •	Nicknames: Delete nicknames or aliases.
            •	"Et al.": Delete "et al." entirely.
            •	Business designations: Drop duplicative business identifiers (omit L.L.C., Inc., etc. if "Co." or "Inc." already makes clear it's a business).
            •	Keep the organization's name; drop trailing business designators if present.
            •   If multiple business designations exist use the first one.
            •	Procedural phrases: Replace phrases with standard forms:
                •	"on behalf of," "on the relation of" → "ex rel."
                •	"petition of," "in the matter of" → "In re"
            •	United States: Always "United States," not "U.S." (unless adjectival, e.g. "U.S. Navy"). Omit "of America."
            •	States: Drop "of," e.g. "State of Washington" → "Washington." Retain "State," "People," or "Commonwealth" if that's the lead word.
            •	Municipalities: Keep "City of" or "Town of" if it's the first part of the name. Drop them if they appear in the middle or end.
            •	Prepositional phrases:
                •	Keep prepositions indicating national/large areas, e.g. "Republic of Korea."
                •	Keep prepositions in business/org names.
                •	Keep municipal prepositional phrases (e.g. "City of Treasure Island").
                •	Omit others (e.g. "Board of Trade of Colorado" → "Board of Trade").
            •	"The": Drop "The" unless part of a popular case name, the monarch ("The Queen"), or the name of the object of an in rem case.
            •	Commissioner of Internal Revenue: Always "Comm'r."
            •	Unions: Omit long tails after the union name; keep widely known acronyms.
            •	Mandamus: If a case is known by the judge's name, note in italics in parenthesis.
            •	Distinct names: If a case has a distinct nickname, include it in parentheses.

2. Unusual abbreviations.
    • Social Security Cases are often First Name, Middle Initial Last Initial or First Name Last Initial. If this occurs keep all initials.
        * For Example,
            William Z. v. Frank Bisignano, Commissioner of Social Security should reduce to `William Z. v. Bisignano` retaining the Z initial.
            John A. C. v. Frank Bisignano, Commissioner of Social Security should reduce to `John A. C. v. Bisignano` retaining both set of initials.
        * THESE RULES ONLY APPLY IF THERE IS NO LAST NAME.
            * For example a name with multiple initials that contains a surname `James F.C. Andrews` should be shortened to just Andrews
        * NEVER reduce a case name to an initial.
    • Double check your work.
        Rule: when the second party has a compound surname the last surname token is the controlling surname for Bluebook shortening, not the embedded compound before it.
            If a case name you are abbreviating contains an unusual ending take extra time
    • Compare the final case name shortened string to the original case name full and look for any inconsistencies or typos.
    • SURNAMES should never be altered.
    • Double check the spelling of all surnames.
    * Triple check
    • Check every letter of the surname to make sure it is correct
