You are given the first page of text of a legal document.

Your tasks:
1. Decide if this is a judicial opinion, memorandum, or order, or some other type of document.
2. Extract:
   - case_name: a normalized short style (e.g., "Smith v. Jones").
   - case_name_full: the full caption exactly as it appears on the page, normalized:
       * remove new lines
       * remove excess whitespace
       * convert all versus indicators (vs., versus, -against-) to "v."
   - case_name_short: one or two words, taken from the non-governmental party if possible (e.g., defendant’s surname or company name).  Case Name Short should enver be shortened to a single Intial. like G.
       * case_name_short Should also not use Commissioners, or other government officials.  If unsure leave it blank
     Do not return "United States", "State", "People", "Attorney General", or other governmental names as the short.

3. Compare the extracted case_name_full to the DOCKET TITLE provided.
   - If they clearly refer to the same case (even with formatting or capitalization differences), set case_name_match = true.
   - If they likely refer to different cases, set case_name_match = false.

Avoid putting docket numbers in the case name full

IF CASE Exists

CAPTION-ONLY RULES
• Extract case_name, case_name_full, and case_name_short **from the caption only**.
• The caption is the party block at the top of the first page, typically between the court heading and the first major heading (e.g., “MEMORANDUM AND ORDER”, “OPINION”, “ORDER”, “BACKGROUND”).
• Ignore all body text, headings, and procedural text outside the caption (e.g., “MEMORANDUM AND ORDER”, “For the reasons stated…”, “IT IS HEREBY ORDERED…”).
• Ignore docket numbers/lines such as “Case No.”, “No.”, “3:24-cv-…”, judge names, division lines, and filing stamps.

* REMEMBER *** CASE NAME SHORT MUST BE GENERATED FROM CASE_NAME
* Double check that case_name_short is contained in case_name

ADVERSARIAL vs NON-ADVERSARIAL

• Only produce “X v. Y” if the caption itself contains a versus connector (“v.”, “vs.”, “versus”, “-against-”).
• If the caption is non-adversarial (“In re…”, “In the Matter of…”, “Ex parte…”, “In the Interest of…”) and has **no** versus connector on the page, do **not** invent “v.” — set `case_name` to the normalized non-adversarial form (e.g., “In the Matter of Osage Marine Services, Inc.”).


Special rules:
- If there is no readable case name and the page looks like a scan/bates stamp/cover sheet, set needs_ocr = true.
- If it's not an opinion/memorandum/order, set is_opinion = false and put a ~10-word explanation in "error".

RETURN JSON only in the exact schema:
{
  "is_opinion": bool,
  "case_name_short": string,
  "case_name": string,
  "case_name_full": string,
  "case_name_match": bool,
  "needs_ocr": bool,
  "error": string | null
