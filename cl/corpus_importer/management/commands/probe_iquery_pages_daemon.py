The goal of this daemon is to ensure that we always have every case in PACER.

It works by taking the highest pacer_case_id we know as of the last iteration,
and then doing geometric probing of higher numbers to discover the highest
current pacer_case_id in each court.

For example, if the highest ID we know about as of 12:00PT is 1000, we would
check ID 1002, then 1004, 1008, 1016, etc., until we stop finding valid cases.
Because cases can be sealed, deleted, etc, we also add jitter to the IDs we
select, to ensure that we don't get stuck due to bad luck.

Once the highest value is found, we schedule iquery download tasks one second
apart to fill in the missing section. For example, if we start at ID 1000, then
learn that ID 1032 is the highest, we'd create 31 celery tasks for items 1000
to 1032, and we'd schedule them over the next 31 seconds.

The last piece of this system is that we have content coming in from a lot of
sources all the time, so we use signals to backfill missing content as well.
For example, if we think 1,000 is the highest ID, and somebody RECAPs a docket
with ID of 1032, the signal will catch that and create tasks to fill in numbers
1001 to 1031.
