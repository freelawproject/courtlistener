# This field mapping is used to define which fields should be updated in the
# Elasticsearch index document when they change in the DB. The outer keys
# represent the actions that will trigger signals:
# save: On model save
# delete: On model delete
# m2m: On many-to-many field changes
# reverse: On ForeignKey reverse relation changes
# For every action key, a dict for each Model that needs to be tracked should
# be added, where the key for these child dicts is the Model.
# In each Model dict, another dict should be added for every query relation
# (relative to the main model) that needs to be tracked. The key for these
# dicts is the query path relative to the main model:
# e.g: opinion__cluster__docket relative to ParentheticalGroup.
# Within each of these dicts, an additional dict containing tracked fields
# should be added. Keys should be the field name on the Model and values
# should be the field name in the ES document.
