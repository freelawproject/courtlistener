    For now, we do this in a very simple way, by using the lastBuildDate field
    and checking if it differs from the last time we checked. One thing that
    makes this approach suboptimal is that we know the `lastBuildDate` field
    varies around the time that the feeds are actually...um, built. For
    example, we've seen the same feed with two different values for this field
    around the time that it is built. When this happens, the two values tend to
    be off by about a minute or so.

    If we were being very careful and really optimizing when we crawled these
    feeds, this would cause us trouble because we'd detect a change in this
    field when the actual data hadn't changed. But because we only crawl the
    feeds at most once every five minutes, and because the gaps we've observed
    in this field tend to only be about one minute, we can get away with this.

    Other solutions/thoughts we can consider later:

     - If the difference between two lastBuildDate values is less than two
       minutes assume it's the same feed.
     - Use hashing of the feed to determine if it has changed.

    One other oddity here is that we use regex parsing to grab the
    lastBuildDate value. This is because parsing the feed properly can take
    several seconds for a big feed.
