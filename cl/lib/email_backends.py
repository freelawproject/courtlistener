    Checks the emails sent in the last 24 hours. Raises ValueError
    if our threshold is exceeded.

    AWS SES uses a sliding window to calculate our email sending quota.
    When it runs out, we cannot recover without waiting ~24 hours, so
    this ensures that we always stay below a configured quota.

    Details: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/manage-sending-quotas.html

    To do this, we implement the "sliding logs" algorithm, roughly as
    described here, but with one modification to minimize memory usage:

    https://medium.com/@SaiRahulAkarapu/rate-limiting-algorithms-using-redis-eb4427b47e33

    Sliding logs is a simple algorithm that logs a timestamp for every
    event that happens. Then, when an event request comes in, it checks
    how many events are in the log during the last period (in our case,
    24 hours), and either rejects or allows the event.

    Our tweak to this algorithm is to lose a small amount of accuracy
    (precisely EMAIL_MAX_TEMP_COUNTER - 1) in exchange for reducing
    the memory by EMAIL_MAX_TEMP_COUNTERÃ—.

    For example, if EMAIL_MAX_TEMP_COUNTER is set to 10, then we log
    one entry to redis for every 10 events (great memory savings). but
    we may reject events at EMAIL_EMERGENCY_THRESHOLD - EMAIL_MAX_TEMP_COUNTER + 1
    instead of precisely when the threshold is exceeded. (E.g., if the
    threshold is 1_000 and temp counter is 10, we might trigger at 991).

    Args:
        r (Redis): The Redis DB to connect to as a connection interface

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the counter is bigger than the threshold from the settings.
