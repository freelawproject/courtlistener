    Much of this code was grabbed from Django:

    1. Prevent open redirect attacks. Imagine getting an email:

      Subject: Your CourtListener account is conformed
      Body: Click here to continue: https://www.courtlistener.com/?next=https://cortlistener.com/evil/thing

    Without proper redirect sanitation, a user might click that link, and get
    redirected to courtlistener.com, which could be a spoof of the real thing.

    1. Prevent illogical redirects. Like, don't let people redirect back to
    the sign-in or register page.

    1. Prevent garbage URLs (like empty ones or ones with spaces)

    1. Prevent dangerous URLs (like JavaScript)

    :param url: The URL to check
    :param request: The user request
    :return True if safe, else False
    """
    sign_in_url = reverse("sign-in") in url
    register_in_url = reverse("register") in url
    # Fixes security vulnerability reported upstream to Python, where
    # whitespace can be provided in the scheme like "java\nscript:alert(bad)"
