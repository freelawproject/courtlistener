def track_in_piwik(func, timeout=0.5, check_bots=True):
    """A decorator to track a request in Piwik.

    This decorator is needed on static assets that we want to track because
    those assets can only be tracked by client-side Piwik if they are accessed
    by a user clicking a link in CourtListener itself. If, for example,
    somebody shares a link or otherwise clicks it outside of CourtListener, we
    don't have an opportunity to run our client-side code on that item, and we
    won't be able to track it.

    The code here wraps a view so that when somebody accesses something like a
    PDF from an external site (and only from an external site), we track that
    properly. If people have a CourtListener referer, we ignore them under the
    assumption that they got tracked client-side.

    :param func: The function that we're wrapping.
    :param timeout: The amount of time the Piwik tracking request has to
    respond. If it does not respond in this amount of time, we time out and
    move on.
    :param check_bots: Whether to check bots before hitting Piwik. Piwik itself
    has robust bot detection, so we can rely on that in general, but it's
    generally better to do some basic blocking here too to avoid even involving
    Piwik if we can. Set this to False if you prefer to rely exclusively on
    Piwik's bot detection.
