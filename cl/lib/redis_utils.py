    Note that this function has a very small race condition between when it
    checks for the key, discovers it doesn't exist, and then creates it. This
    race condition is unfortunate. It can be fixed in one of two ways. A Lua
    script could be set up in the Redis server as described here:

      https://stackoverflow.com/a/36645586/64911

    Or Redis can be upgraded to a version where the SET command has a KEEPTTL
    parameter. Using that, you can set the value while keeping the TTL it might
    already have. In #1675 we learned that the obvious way of doing this, using
    getset, deletes the TTL from a key, making that approach untenable. So,
    instead of using that approach, or using a Lua script, we just accept the
    possibility of a race condition.
