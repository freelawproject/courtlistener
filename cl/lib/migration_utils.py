    This is a rather un-fun utility to load a fixture during a migration. It 
    works by monkey patching the normal fixture code with code that can load 
    fixtures at a certain point in a migration, ie, not using the current state
    of the models.

    :param schema_editor: The schema at the time of the migration.
    :param fixture: A path to the fixture to be loaded.
    :param app_label: The app label the fixture should be loaded into.
