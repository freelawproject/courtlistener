<opinion_text>  We granted leave to appeal in this case, consolidated on appeal with <italic>People v Vermeulen</italic>, <cross_reference>432 Mich. 32</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>438 N.W.2d 36</cross_reference> (1989), to consider the application of the spousal communication privilege set forth in § 2162 of the Revised Judicature Act.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> We conclude that the Court of Appeals correctly held that the privilege bars the<page_number>Page 161</page_number>
testimony of the defendant's wife in this case and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.

<center>                                    I</center>
Section 2162 of the RJA provides two distinct privileges. The first, the spousal privilege, is only applicable when the witness and the spouse are married at the time of trial. This privilege bars one spouse from testifying for or against the other without the other's consent except in (1) actions for divorce, (2) prosecutions for bigamy or for a crime committed against the children of either or both, (3) actions growing out of a personal wrong or injury done by one to the other or the refusal or neglect to furnish the spouse or children with suitable support, (4) cases of desertion or abandonment, and (5) certain cases relating to marriage and title to property.<page_number>Page 162</page_number>

The second privilege, the communication privilege, bars one spouse from testifying "as to any communications made by one to the other during the marriage" without the consent of the other. The communication privilege applies whether the testimony is sought "during the marriage <italic>or afterwards,"</italic> as long as the communication occurred during the marriage. Section 2162 of the RJA states no exceptions with respect to the communication privilege.

<center>                                   II</center>
Hamacher was convicted of second-degree criminal sexual conduct with his stepdaughter who was eight years old at the time of the alleged acts. At trial, the court denied his motion to suppress testimony by his wife concerning statements, Hamacher allegedly made regarding his conduct with his stepdaughter.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The Court of Appeals initially affirmed Hamacher's conviction. It ruled that the wife's testimony was properly admitted because the Legislature intended that the exception to the general spousal privilege for prosecutions concerning crimes committed against either spouse's children be applicable to the communication privilege and because the defendant and his wife were "in the process of divorce at the time of trial" and therefore "strict adherence to the rule would not further its purpose of fostering the marital relationship."<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>

This Court vacated the judgment of the Court of<page_number>Page 163</page_number>
Appeals and remanded the cause to it for reconsideration, stating that § 2162 of the RJA "contains no exception to the privilege regarding communications between a husband and wife where the husband and wife are separated or are in the process of obtaining a divorce. The defendant and his wife remained husband and wife at the time the communication in question was allegedly made."<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

On remand, the Court of Appeals held that "the admission of defendant's wife's statements in the instant case is in contravention of the confidential communication privilege," stating that "the statute makes no exception for divorced or separated couples."<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>

On appeal in this Court, the prosecutor contends that (a) the statutory exceptions applicable to the spousal privilege apply or should be made applicable by this Court to the communication privilege, and (b) Hamacher waived his right to object to the admission of his wife's testimony at trial because he failed to object to her testimony at the preliminary examination.

<center>                                   III</center>
When the statutory privileges that are now codified in § 2162 of the RJA were originally enacted in 1861, there were no exceptions.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> The general spousal privilege, the communication privilege, and an adultery "preclusion" were clearly separated by semicolons:

<block_quote>    A husband shall not be examined as a witness for or against his wife, without her consent, nor a<page_number>Page 164</page_number>
wife for or against her husband, without his consent; nor shall either, during the marriage or afterwards, be, without the consent of both, examined as to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage; but in any action or proceedings instituted by the husband or wife in consequence of adultery, the husband and wife shall not be competent to testify. [<cross_reference>1861 PA 125</cross_reference>.]</block_quote>

When the exceptions were added,<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> they were set<page_number>Page 165</page_number>
forth immediately following the general spousal privilege. When the exception for bigamy prosecutions was added as a separate section, the Legislature expressly provided that this exception did not apply to the communication privilege:

<block_quote>    That a husband may testify for or against his wife without her consent, and a wife may testify for or against her husband without his consent, in all criminal prosecutions, for bigamy: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to permit a husband or wife to testify against the other without the consent of both concerning any communications made by one to the other during the marriage.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

The Judicature Act of 1915<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference> added an exception for divorce cases following the general spousal privilege and included the bigamy exception in that portion of the statute. At the same time, the punctuation was revised and the language of the marital privilege took its present form. An exception to the general spousal privilege for the prosecution of crimes against the children of one or both spouses was added in 1939.<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference>

The evolution of § 2162 of the RJA and its clear and unambiguous language indicate that the enumerated exceptions apply only to the general<page_number>Page 166</page_number>
spousal privilege and not to the communication privilege. The Legislature has frequently amended the statute when it was deemed necessary. "Privileges are governed by common law, except as modified by statute or court rule. MRE 501. Since there is no court rule governing marital privileges, the statute controls."<italic>People v Love</italic>, <cross_reference>425 Mich. 691</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>699</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>391 N.W.2d 738</cross_reference> (1986) (opinion of CAVANAGH, J.).

We have considered <italic>Hunt v Eaton</italic>, <cross_reference>55 Mich. 362</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>366</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>21 N.W. 429</cross_reference>
(1884), discussed in the dissenting opinion,<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference> where this Court mentioned a number of considerations in concluding that the communication privilege "includes every communication between [husband and wife] other than such as involves the title to the separate property of either when it becomes necessary to resort to litigation to obtain, secure or protect the rights of either to such separate property."

In <italic>Vermeulen, supra</italic>, p 39, this Court said that "only confidential communications are protected by the communication privilege," and that "the nature and circumstances of the communication may be considered in determining whether the communication was confidential."

It has been said that among the factors that "may serve to rebut a claim that confidentiality was intended"<footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference> is "that the communication relates to business transactions," such as "business agreements between the spouses, or about business matters transacted by one spouse as agent for the other, or about property or conveyances."<footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference> Professor McCormick explained that "[u]sually such<page_number>Page 167</page_number>
statements relate to facts which are intended later to become publicly known."<footnote_reference>[fn14]</footnote_reference>

In <italic>Hagerman v Wigent</italic>, <cross_reference>108 Mich. 192</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>194</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>65 N.W. 756</cross_reference> (1896), this Court anticipated McCormick's rationale when it based its holding, that a husband could testify that his wife had delivered a mortgage to him with instructions to deliver it after her death to her nephews, who were the mortgagors, on its assessment that the circumstances "involved an expectation on her part that the communication would be disclosed," and therefore it "cannot be said to have been confidential."<footnote_reference>[fn15]</footnote_reference>

Implicit in the assumption of a legal obligation to repay is the intent that either party to the transaction may testify concerning communications relating to the transaction should the lending spouse commence an action to enforce the legal obligation that arose when money was borrowed.

The statement Hamacher allegedly made to his wife did not concern a transaction "intended later to become publicly known."

<center>                                   IV</center>
The prosecutor contends that Hamacher's failure to object to his wife's testimony at the preliminary examination precluded objection at the trial. The prosecutor contends alternatively that Hamacher's wife was rendered "unavailable" when he invoked the communication privilege,<footnote_reference>[fn16]</footnote_reference> and,<page_number>Page 168</page_number>
therefore, her prior recorded testimony at the preliminary examination could have been read to the jury pursuant to MRE 804(b)(1).<footnote_reference>[fn17]</footnote_reference>

The prosecutor did not raise the waiver issue or his alternative claim until he filed his brief in this Court. He thus failed to preserve either the waiver issue or his alternative claim for appeal.<footnote_reference>[fn18]</footnote_reference><page_number>Page 169</page_number>

<center>                                    V</center>
We conclude that the Court of Appeals correctly held that the wife's testimony was inadmissible. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the cause to the trial court for a new trial.

BRICKLEY, CAVANAGH, and ARCHER, JJ., concurred with LEVIN, J.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn18]</footnote_number> The prosecutor did not raise the waiver issue in the trial court when Hamacher's lawyer, assigned on a finding of indigency to replace the lawyer who represented him at the preliminary examination, objected at the trial to the wife's testimony concerning the communication. The prosecutor persuaded the judge to allow the wife to testify on grounds other than waiver.

Nor did the prosecutor alternatively raise the waiver issue in response to Hamacher's arguments in his brief filed with the Court of Appeals on appeal from his conviction.

The prosecutor had a further opportunity to raise the issue when Hamacher, after the Court of Appeals initially affirmed his conviction, filed an application for leave to appeal with this Court and still a further opportunity when Hamacher filed a petition for reconsideration after this Court denied leave to appeal, <cross_reference>426 Mich. 867</cross_reference> (1986). He did not do so.

We granted reconsideration, and, as previously noted, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded to the Court of Appeals for further consideration. Although we said in so doing that § 2162 of the RJA contained no exception to the communication privilege where a husband and wife were separated or in the process of obtaining a divorce — one of the predicates of the trial judge's ruling overruling Hamacher's objection at trial to his wife's testimony — the prosecutor did not raise the waiver issue in his brief filed on remand to the Court of Appeals.

After the Court of Appeals on remand reversed Hamacher's conviction, the prosecutor filed an application for leave to appeal with this Court which, again, did not raise the waiver issue. This Court's order granting leave to appeal did not limit the issues, and the prosecutor raised the waiver issue for the first time in his brief in this Court.

Hamacher's lawyer did not respond in his brief in this Court to the waiver issue. During oral argument, one of the justices asked Hamacher's lawyer whether he had a response. Hamacher's lawyer said that the prosecutor had raised the issue for the first time on appeal.</footnote_body>

</opinion_text>
<opinion_byline>  LEVIN, J. (<italic>separate opinion</italic>).

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  The Court's conclusion that the prosecutor failed to preserve either the waiver issue or his alternative claim for appeal makes it unnecessary for the Court to consider whether the failure of Hamacher's lawyer to object to his wife's testimony at the preliminary examination precluded objection at the trial.

The dissenting opinion discusses case law concerning waiver of testimonial privileges, and "conclude[s] that the defendant's failure to assert the spousal privilege at that examination operated as a general waiver of the privilege."<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

The dissenting opinion states that the confidential communication privilege can be waived, and I<page_number>Page 170</page_number>
agree.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> A failure to object does not, however, necessarily constitute a waiver<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> precluding assertion of a right or privilege at a "new trial." If it were otherwise, the general rule would not be that a failure to object does not ordinarily bar objection at a new trial.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

<center>                                    I</center>
The general rule is that upon a new trial<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> the case is to be retried de novo "as if it had not been<page_number>Page 171</page_number>
tried before and without prejudice to either party"; when a "new trial was ordered, the parties started again from their pleadings."<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> Evidentiary objections that were not voiced at an earlier trial, may be asserted at a new trial unless the other side would be prejudiced thereby.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>

The dissenting opinion asserts that the general rule is inapplicable to a failure to object to privileged testimony because the "confidential communication privilege acts to hold inviolate the privacy of the marital relationship. When facts which might otherwise be privileged are disclosed for all to inspect, the purpose of the privilege is destroyed. Just as one cannot unring a bell, a secret<page_number>Page 172</page_number>
once disclosed in open court is never again a wholly private matter."<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference>

<center>                                   II</center>
The dissenting opinion dismisses in a footnote this Court's decision in <italic>Briesenmeister v Knights of Pythias</italic>, <cross_reference>81 Mich. 525</cross_reference>;<cross_reference>45 N.W. 977</cross_reference> (1890), stating that <italic>Briesenmeister</italic> relied on a decision of the New York Court of Appeals that had already been overruled by a later decision of the New York Court of Appeals.<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference>

In <italic>Briesenmeister, supra</italic>, p 534, the trial court had granted the plaintiff's motion to strike a physician's testimony on the basis of the physician-patient privilege. Some of the stricken testimony was not privileged, and this Court ordered a new trial. Although the plaintiff's motion to strike came after the completion of the physician's testimony and this Court acknowledged that the privilege must be claimed "before the testimony is admitted, or it ceases to be a privilege, and is<italic>waived</italic>, where no objection is made to the introduction of the testimony" (emphasis supplied), it nevertheless ruled that, at the new trial it had ordered, the plaintiff could again assert the privilege.

The Court disagreed with the rationale of the later decision of the New York Court of Appeals, <italic>McKinney v Grand Street, PP  FR</italic><italic>Co</italic>, <cross_reference>104 N.Y. 352</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>10 N.E. 544</cross_reference> (1887). In <italic>McKinney</italic>, the court said that where there is a failure to object at a trial and the confidential communication is published in<page_number>Page 173</page_number>
court, "`no further injury can be inflicted upon the rights and interests which the statute was intended to protect, and there is no further reason for its enforcement.'" <italic>Briesenmeister, supra</italic>, p 535, quoting from <italic>McKinney.</italic><footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference>

The Court responded that the "argument loses sight of one of the rights conferred by the statute. Privilege includes both the security against publication, <italic>and the right to control the</italic><italic>introduction in evidence</italic>, of such information or knowledge communicated to or possessed by the physician."<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference> (Emphasis added.) The Court continued:

<block_quote>    <italic>The latter right exists although the former has</italic> <italic>ceased to be of any benefit. The public may know; but</italic> <italic>shall the jury be permitted to receive and weigh</italic> <italic>testimony derived from a source which the law has put</italic> <italic>the seal of silence upon</italic>, unless released by the party who alone has the right to say whether that particular witness shall be the medium of conveying such knowledge to the jury? For instance, the party may have disclosed to a third person all that he has to his physician. Now, <italic>while his admissions may be</italic> <italic>proved in a proper manner by such third person, they</italic> <italic>cannot be proved by the physician against the</italic> <italic>objection of the party.</italic><footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference> [Emphasis added.]</block_quote>

The court concluded that an earlier New York case, <italic>Grattan v</italic><italic>Metropolitan Life Ins Co</italic>, <cross_reference>92 N.Y. 274</cross_reference>; 44 AR 372 (1883), "lays down the better rule."<footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference>

The Supreme Court of Iowa reached the same conclusion in<italic>Burgess v Sims Drug Co</italic>, <cross_reference>114 Iowa 275</cross_reference><page_number>Page 174</page_number>
; 86 N.W. 307 (1901), citing <italic>Briesenmeister</italic> and <italic>Grattan</italic>
approvingly. The court said that it did not agree with the reasoning in <italic>McKinney.</italic>

The Supreme Court of Arkansas similarly concluded, citing the "well considered opinions" in <italic>Briesenmeister</italic> and <italic>Burgess</italic>, that the failure at one trial to object to the introduction of testimony on the ground of privilege did not waive the right to make such objection at a subsequent trial of the same case where the adversary had not been misled by the failure to object.<italic>Maryland Casualty Co v Maloney</italic>, <cross_reference>119 Ark. 434</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>441</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>178 S.W. 387</cross_reference>
(1915).

The Court of Appeals has similarly read <italic>Briesenmeister</italic> as recognizing "the dual nature of the [physician-patient] privilege conferred," securing both "`against publication, and the right to control the introduction in evidence. . . .'"<footnote_reference>[fn14]</footnote_reference>

<center>                                   III</center>
In <italic>State v Clark</italic>, <cross_reference>296 N.W.2d 372</cross_reference> (Minn, 1980), relied on in the dissenting opinion, the Minnesota Supreme Court stated its conclusion without any discussion of <italic>McKinney, Grattan,</italic><italic>Briesenmeister, Burgess, Maryland Casualty</italic>, or any other case discussing the issue there decided,<footnote_reference>[fn15]</footnote_reference> with a "cf."<page_number>Page 175</page_number>

In the physician-patient privilege context, the patient generally needs medical testimony to support his claims in an action that he generally has commenced. The physician-patient privilege has been limited by case law and statute in New York and by statute and court rule in this state.<footnote_reference>[fn20]</footnote_reference><page_number>Page 177</page_number>

Section 2162 of the Revised Judicature Act does not purport to bar a spouse from disclosing a confidential communication. Hamacher's wife, without violating § 2162, related the statement she attributed to her husband to social service workers, police officers, the prosecutor, and could have done so to newspaper and other reporters. She could indeed have gone on the nightly news and made a full statement of the confidential communication without violating § 2162. The "secret" would then no longer have been secret and "never again a wholly private matter." Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that despite the wide communication to the world at large of the "secret," Hamacher's wife could not, consistent with § 2162, "be examined" in court with regard to the communication.<page_number>Page 178</page_number>

Professor Wigmore propounded the so-called utilitarian justification for the testimonial privileges: "public policy requires the encouragement of the communications without which these relationships cannot be effective."<footnote_reference>[fn21]</footnote_reference> Professor McCormick disagreed.<footnote_reference>[fn22]</footnote_reference>

In the current revision of Professor McCormick's work, the privacy rationale set forth in the dissenting opinion is advanced, and at the same time it is acknowledged that it is unlikely this rationale was in the legislative mind when the privilege was enacted.<footnote_reference>[fn23]</footnote_reference> The authors also acknowledge they hope that adoption of the privacy rationale will result in the ultimate abolition of the communication privilege.<footnote_reference>[fn24]</footnote_reference>

The "privacy of the marital relationship" rationale might appropriately be assessed by the Legislature, were it to consider revising RJA § 2162, or by this Court, were it to take upon itself the task of reshaping the testimonial privileges in the exercise of its rule-making power concerning practice and procedure.<footnote_reference>[fn25]</footnote_reference> Upon such consideration, the Legislature or this Court might conclude that the "logical<page_number>Page 179</page_number>
implications"<footnote_reference>[fn26]</footnote_reference> of adoption of the privacy rationale are incompatible with the societal goals sought to be fostered by the communication privilege, especially if the ultimate logical implication is the abolition altogether of the communication privilege.

The Legislature or this Court, might, upon such a reassessment, also conclude that to adopt maintenance of secrecy as a rationale for the marital communication or other testimonial privileges could unnecessarily enlarge the scope of the privileges and encourage litigation — unnecessarily enlarge because a literal reading of the communication privilege, as barring a spouse from "be[ing] examined" in court regarding the communication, is quite adequate and therefore the language expressing the privilege does not need tinkering.

In all events, the courts should not, as long as they purport to be expounding a <italic>statutory</italic> privilege, adopt rationales that cannot be found upon reference to the legislative history of the privilege, propounded by acknowledged revisionists — whether they be respected scholars like Professors Wigmore and McCormick, their current successors, or other advocates — that might provide a juridical basis for accomplishing by judicial decision, "pour[ing] new wine into old bottles,"<footnote_reference>[fn27]</footnote_reference> that which neither the Legislature nor this Court has been willing to undertake, the unraveling of the communication privilege ad hoc and ad hominem.

The courts have no basis for declaring that the statutory purpose in 1861 was to protect the secrecy of the communication when the statute itself clearly does not purport to do so. There is no basis for concluding in 1989 — over one hundred twenty-five years after enactment — that the legislative<page_number>Page 180</page_number>
purpose in 1861 was other than the literally stated purpose of precluding the spouse from "be[ing] examined" in court.

There being no legislative intention, expressed or implied, that the spouse may be examined once the secret is disclosed and it is no longer a private matter, the only expression in the statute being that the witness may not "be examined," this Court's well-considered and well-regarded decision in<italic>Briesenmeister</italic> should not be overruled. <italic>Briesenmeister</italic> was decided by justices who served on this Court relatively soon after the enactment of the testimonial privileges and who thus were more likely than presently sitting judges or justices to have been aware of any "secrecy" or "privacy" rationale unstated but nevertheless intended by the Legislature.

In <italic>People v Lowe</italic>, <cross_reference>96 Misc.2d 33</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>408 N.Y.S.2d 873</cross_reference> (1978), the judge ordered discovery of the complainant's medical records and a psychiatric examination of the complainant stating that the complainant had voluntarily stated and thereby waived further inquiry into his mental condition when he testified that he suffered some brain damage which impaired his thinking and communication abilities.

The Court said that the letters had "escaped" from the husband's clothing and were found on the floor and that there was no collusion between the husband and the person who found them. It has been suggested that the communicating spouse assumes the risk of loss or misdelivery of a writing as distinguished from disclosure due to the betrayal or connivance of the spouse to whom delivered.

</opinion_text><dissent_byline>  BOYLE, J. (<italic>dissenting</italic>).

</dissent_byline><dissent_text>  The majority today reaches the conclusion that the exceptions contained in MCL <cross_reference>600.2162</cross_reference>; MSA 27A.2162 do not apply to communications between spouses.

Preservation of marital harmony becomes mere rubric where one spouse is willing to testify against another in the circumstances described in the statute. Worse, it is a cruel and demeaning fiction justified by no purpose other than to promote the interest of the adverse spouse and having no effect save, as in this case, to obstruct the fact-finding process and to remind us that even in 1989 we are all not equal before the law.

Revised Judicature Act § 2162 should be construed so as to find the privilege inapplicable to the exceptions because the purpose of the statute was to remove common-law disability; the general public policy of this state is to accord married women full equality before the law, subject only to policy interests deemed paramount by the Legislature;<page_number>Page 181</page_number>
and, where one of the situations listed in the statute has occurred, damage has been done to the marital relationship far more shocking than revealing a communication. In these situations, the Legislature has determined that protection of marital privacy is a less important societal interest than the right to testify fully as to a violation of civil or criminal rights.

As long ago as 1884, in the context of interpreting the predecessor statute which provided for an exception in cases of an action between spouses involving the title to separate property, this Court held that the exception applied to the privilege. The Court found that the identical words we consider today, "[N]or shall either, during the marriage or afterwards, without the consent of both, be examined as to any communication made by one to the other, during the marriage," allowed a wife to testify as to promises made to her in the privacy of their chamber and with no one else present. In words equally applicable to this case, the Court stated:

<block_quote>    [T]he statute removes the common-law disability and permits either to testify to the facts which lie at the foundation of the ownership of the property as fully as if such marriage relation did not exist. The clause of the statute prohibiting either, during marriage or afterwards, without the consent of both, being examined as to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage, <italic>does not apply to</italic> <italic>cases of this kind.</italic></block_quote>

*   *   *

<block_quote>    No doubt society is interested in preserving the harmony of the marriage relations and anything which tends to disrupt those relations is to be discountenanced. The Constitution has secured to a married woman the right of acquisition, enjoyment and disposition of her separate property, and<page_number>Page 182</page_number>
the Legislature has given her the same standing in the courts with respect thereto as if she were unmarried; and there is no good reason why she should not have the means of protecting those rights as fully against her husband as against any other person. . . . So far as the destruction of harmony in the family circle is concerned, the injury is inflicted when the husband or wife fail[s] to keep their agreements . . ., and the strife and bickerings consequent thereon long precede the shock caused by permitting the party to testify respecting the title to such property. [<italic>Hunt v Eaton</italic>, <cross_reference>55 Mich. 362</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>365-366</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>21 N.W. 429</cross_reference> (1884).

The majority dismisses the decision in <italic>Hunt</italic> as based not on the application of the exceptions to the communications privilege but, rather, on the idea that the statements involved were not confidential since they involved business transactions. This interpretation ignores the fact that the Court clearly concluded in <italic>Hunt</italic> that the communications privilege simply did not apply to "cases of this kind," and that "[t]o hold that it did would nullify in a great measure the language which precedes it and make a limitation upon the exception where in my opinion none was intended." <italic>Id.</italic>, p 366. Indeed, the majority in this case, by arguing that the communication in <italic>Hunt</italic> was not confidential, apparently chooses to ignore the statement by Justice CHAMPLIN that he did "not consider it necessary to indicate the nature of the communications between husband and wife about which neither is allowed to be examined. . . ." <italic>Id.</italic>

In 1887, in interpreting an amendment to the statute which excepted cases "where the cause of action grows out of a personal wrong or injury done by one to the other," <cross_reference>1885 PA 211</cross_reference>, the Court said:<page_number>Page 183</page_number>

<block_quote>    Not only the ends of justice, but public policy alike, require that she should be at liberty to complain and prosecute as if she were a <italic>feme sole</italic>

<block_quote>    Thus it will be seen that it is the policy of the law to extend the right of the wife to bear testimony against the husband in cases of violation of her personal rights, rather than to restrict it.

Despite these venerable statements of policy regarding the purpose of the statute and the express holding that the communications privilege did <italic>not</italic> apply to the statutory exception, the majority concludes that our Legislature, in enacting the Revised Judicature Act in 1961, intended to permit a defendant spouse to silence his wife in the situations excepted by the statute. Surely a contemporary Legislature was as cognizant of the notion "that there is no good reason why she should not have the means of protecting [her] rights as fully against her husband as against any other person" and that the injury to the marital relationship is done when the "personal wrong or injury" (or "crime committed against the children of either or both") occurs. MCL <cross_reference>600.2162</cross_reference>; MSA 27A.2162.

To presume a sunset of enlightenment in a Legislature that has repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to a woman as <italic>"feme sole"</italic>
in a legal<page_number>Page 184</page_number>
matter is to ignore history.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> I cannot agree that the Legislature intended to reimpose the common-law disability and prevent a willing<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> witness, usually a woman, from "testify[ing] . . . as fully as if such marriage relation did not exist."

Despite prior precedent, sound public policy, and simple justice, the majority holds that, for want of a semicolon, the Legislature intended to deprive this mother of the right to testify as to her husband's admission to sexual contact with her daughter. I disagree and would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.

The marital privileges can be traced to the period of our history when a woman, possessing no legal identity of her own, was treated as the chattel of her husband. The unity of identity between a husband and wife affirmed and advanced these cultural perceptions. Consequently, two canons of medieval jurisprudence came into play.

<block_quote>    [F]irst, the rule that an accused was not permitted to testify in his own behalf because of his interest in the proceeding; second, the concept that husband and wife were one, and that since the woman had no recognized separate legal existence, the husband was that one. From those two now long-abandoned doctrines, it followed that what was inadmissible from the lips of the defendant-husband was also inadmissible from his wife.<page_number>Page 185</page_number>

Quite simply, a wife was disqualified from testifying against her husband.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> This practice later became a gender-neutral rule of exclusion. When this general rule of disqualification fell into disfavor, it was replaced by a privilege to exclude spousal testimony. <italic>Id.</italic> See <italic>Developments in the law, privileged</italic><italic>communications</italic>, 98 Harv L R 1450, 1563-1565 (1985). With the passage of <cross_reference>1861 PA 125</cross_reference>, Michigan codified the rule of conditional competency or spousal bar and enacted a separate privilege protecting from disclosure at a judicial proceeding all confidential communications between spouses made during the marriage.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> Thus, the term marital privilege refers to two distinct privileges: the right to bar the spouse from testifying<page_number>Page 186</page_number>
and the right to prevent the spouse from revealing confidential communications.

The privilege to bar the testimony of a spouse is defended on the basis that it prevents marital discord. It is an offshoot of the rule of incompetency. <italic>People v Love</italic>, <cross_reference>425 Mich. 691</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>700</cross_reference>;<cross_reference>391 N.W.2d 738</cross_reference> (1986) (opinion of CAVANAGH, J.). The confidential communications privilege is said to inspire marital confidences. McCormick, Evidence (3d ed), § 86, p 201. Over time, case law has blurred the justifications, and it is sometimes observed that the validity of both privileges rests on the utilitarian ground of promoting marital harmony.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> See <italic>Privileged communications,</italic><italic>supra</italic>, pp 1578-1579; <italic>Love, supra</italic>, p 711, n 1 (opinion of BOYLE, J.).

Criticism of both marital privileges centers on the fact that they conflict with the jurisprudential objective of advancing the truth-finding function.<page_number>Page 187</page_number>
As Professor McCormick observes, "while the danger of injustice from suppression of relevant proof is clear and certain, the probable benefits of the rule of privilege in encouraging marital confidences and wedded harmony is at best doubtful and marginal." McCormick, <italic>supra</italic>, § 86, p 202. Thus, even at common law the spousal bar was withheld from the husband in prosecutions for wrongs directly against the wife.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> Similarly, when in this country statutes were enacted providing for the privilege for confidential communications, an exception to the confidential communication privilege was incorporated and frequently extended in cases involving wrongs against a spouse, particularly those of a violent nature.

As Professor McCormick explains:

<block_quote>    The common law privilege against adverse testimony of a spouse was subject to an exception in cases of prosecution of the husband for offenses against the wife, at least those of violence. When nineteenth century statutes in this country limited and regulated this privilege and the incompetency of spouses as witnesses and defined the new statutory privilege for confidential communications the common law exception above mentioned was usually incorporated and extended, and frequently other exceptions were added. Under these statutes it is not always clear how far the exceptions are intended to apply only to the provisions limiting the competency of the spouses as witnesses, or whether they apply also to the privilege for confidential communications. <italic>Frequently, however, in the absence</italic> <italic>of a contrary decision, it is at least arguable that</italic> <italic>the exception does have this latter application, and</italic> <italic>in some instances this intent is clearly expressed.</italic> <italic>Any other result would, in principle, indeed be</italic> <italic>difficult to justify.</italic> [McCormick, <italic>supra</italic>, § 84, pp 198-199. Emphasis added.]</block_quote><page_number>Page 188</page_number>

This Court also has recognized that the marital privileges stand contrary to the maxim "the public has a right to every man's evidence. . . ." <italic>Love, supra</italic>, p 712 (opinion of BOYLE, J.); 8 Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton rev), § 2192, p 70. Therefore we have consistently recognized that privileges

<block_quote>  must be strictly construed and accepted "only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth." [<italic>Love, supra</italic>, pp 700-701 (opinion of CAVANAGH, J.); p 712 (opinion of BOYLE, J.); see also  <italic>O'Toole v Ohio German Fire Ins Co</italic>, <cross_reference>159 Mich. 187</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>193</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>123 N.W. 795</cross_reference> (1909).]</block_quote>

<center>                                    A</center>
The majority's construction of the statute is that the statute is unambiguous and that the exceptions to the privilege to bar a spouse's testimony do not apply to confidential communications. One spouse may now apparently permanently prevent another from testifying to a confidential communication in a civil proceeding in which the spouses are adverse parties (such as "suits for divorces," and cases involving the title to the separate property of the husband or wife, in cases of "crime[s] committed against the children of either or both," and to those cases "where the cause of action grows out of a personal wrong or injury done by one to the other").

This analysis requires us to conclude that our Legislature does not extend even the common-law exception for crimes of violence against a spouse to<page_number>Page 189</page_number>
confidential communications. I am unwilling to ascribe such an intent to our Legislature.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>

As the majority interprets the Legislature's intent, a wife is allowed to testify at her husband's trial for the sexual abuse of her daughter, but the exception does not extend to permit her testimony concerning his admission of the assault. Thus, on the retrial ordered today, the jury will not be allowed to learn of the defendant's explanation to his wife as to why this assault occurred and will be required to resolve this issue on the basis of the testimony of a child who was eight years old at the time of the alleged occurrence.

Assuming that the Legislature created marital privileges to promote marital harmony and marital privacy, I cannot agree that the Legislature that enacted this statute in 1961 found these interests so paramount as to bar all relevant proof that involves a private communication between spouses. To do so would leave women and their children without the means of protecting their rights "as fully against her husband as against any other person." <italic>Hunt v Eaton, supra</italic>, p 366.

As Professor Wigmore observed in discussing the common-law exception to the spousal bar:

<block_quote>    [I]f the promotion of marital peace, and the apprehension of marital dissension, are the ultimate ground of the privilege, it is an overgenerous assumption that the wife who has been beaten, poisoned or deserted is still on such terms of delicate good feeling with her spouse that her testimony must not be enforced lest the iridescent halo of peace be dispelled by the breath of disparaging testimony. And if there were, conceivably,<page_number>Page 190</page_number>
any such peace, would it be a peace such as the law could desire to protect? [8 Wigmore, <italic>supra</italic>, § <cross_reference>2239</cross_reference>, p 243.]</block_quote>

<center>                                    B</center>
A literal reading of the act appears to support the majority's result. However, the statute is ambiguous and this reading is not consistent with this Court's holding in <italic>Hunt v Eaton, supra</italic>, with the accepted axiom that "privileges should be narrowly defined and exceptions thereto broadly construed," <italic>People v</italic><italic>Love, supra</italic>, p 700, nor with the long-established and recognized policy of the law "to extend the right of the wife to bear testimony against the husband . . . rather than to restrict it,"<italic>People v Sebring, supra</italic>, p 707.

After no less than seventeen amendments and reenactment of the marriage privileges spanning nearly one hundred and fifty years of legislative action and despite these well-established guides to construction, the majority rejects Justice CHAMPLIN's statement that the "statute removes the common-law disability and permits either to testify . . . as fully as if such marriage relationship did not exist," on the basis of the punctuation in the statute. <italic>Hunt v Eaton, supra</italic>, p 365.

When amended in 1869, the passage dealing with the spousal bar was split with a semicolon, and that clause was separated from the newly added property title exception by a comma:

<block_quote>    A husband shall not be examined as a witness, for or against his wife, without her consent; nor a wife, for or against her husband, without his consent, except in cases. . . . [<cross_reference>1869 PA 84</cross_reference>.]</block_quote>

That manner of punctuation is maintained in the present statute.<page_number>Page 191</page_number>

If we are to assume, as does the majority, that the Legislature intended this semicolon as a definite demarcation, we must also conclude that the exceptions apply only in the instance where a wife is asked to testify for or against her husband, but not when a husband is asked to testify for or against his wife. Of course, such a conclusion is wholly unjustified.

Furthermore, if the grammar and punctuation of § 2162 is as indicative of legislative intent as the majority believes, the significance of <cross_reference>1897 PA 212</cross_reference> should not be overlooked. Public Act 212 provided:

<block_quote>    That a husband may testify for or against his wife without her consent, and a wife may testify for or against her husband without his consent, in all criminal prosecutions, for bigamy: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to permit a husband or wife to testify against the other without the consent of both concerning any communications made by one to the other during the marriage.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    All acts or parts of acts conflicting with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed. [Emphasis omitted.]</block_quote>

When this exception for bigamy prosecutions was incorporated into the general privilege statute in <cross_reference>1915 PA 314</cross_reference>, ch XVII, § 67, the express proviso precluding spousal testimony concerning confidential communications was eliminated. Had the Legislature intended the exceptions listed in the act to apply only to the spousal testimonial privilege, the proviso emphasizing that intent should have survived. In the absence of the proviso, the logical conclusion to draw is that the Legislature intended the exceptions to apply to both privileges. The majority, in effect, reads a proviso into the act where none exists and draws a contrary conclusion.<page_number>Page 192</page_number>
In this manner, the majority finds that the "clear and unambiguous" nature of § 2162 both commands the opposite result and forecloses a reasoned explanation of legislative purpose.

The justification for the communication privilege is to protect marital harmony and encourage marital communication. Each exception in the statute represents an instance where the Legislature has balanced the interest in marital harmony against a competing and overriding interest in fully vindicating the witness or party spouse's rights. The majority focuses on the Legislature's purpose in 1861 and assumes that today one spouse is permitted to completely silence the other to uphold the integrity of marital confidences. Justice LEVIN's opinion,<italic>ante</italic>, pp 179-180. The proper focus, in my view, should be on the Legislature's purpose in 1961 when it recognized that in certain instances, such as civil cases in which the spouses are adversaries, cases involving harm to a child of either or both, or those in which a personal wrong or injury is done by one spouse to another, the privilege must yield to the need for probative evidence<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> in order to vindicate the rights in controversy.<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference>

Even if the exceptions listed in § 2162 do not<page_number>Page 193</page_number>
apply to the confidential communication privilege, defendant Hamacher waived the privilege when he failed to object to his wife's testimony at his preliminary examination.<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference> This Court has long recognized that the communication privilege "is the privilege of the parties . . . and may be waived." <italic>O'Toole,</italic><italic>supra</italic>, p 192; <italic>Benson v Morgan</italic>, <cross_reference>50 Mich. 77</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>79</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>14 N.W. 705</cross_reference>
(1883).<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference> Such waiver may be express or implied. 8 Wigmore,<italic>supra</italic>, § <cross_reference>2340</cross_reference>, pp 671-672. Implied waiver was found in <italic>Benson</italic><italic>v Morgan, supra</italic>, where a husband who was present in court failed to object when his wife was called to testify against him. Similarly, in <italic>People v Toner</italic>, <cross_reference>217 Mich. 640</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>643-644</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>187 N.W. 386</cross_reference>
(1922), this Court concluded that when a defendant calls his wife as a witness in his defense, the marital privileges are waived as to all pertinent facts, and cross-examination need not be limited to facts elicited on direct examination. Here the defendant did not call his wife as a witness, but he did fail to object to her testimony at the preliminary examination. I would conclude that the defendant's failure to assert the spousal privilege at that examination operated as a general waiver of the privilege.

Once waived, a privilege may not be reasserted by a defendant at a later stage of the same proceeding or at any subsequent judicial proceeding.<footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference> As Professor Wigmore states:<page_number>Page 194</page_number>

<block_quote>    A waiver at a <italic>former trial</italic> should bar a claim of the [physician-patient] privilege at a later trial, for the original disclosure takes away once and for all the confidentiality sought to be protected by the privilege. To enforce it thereafter is to seek to preserve a privacy which exists in legal fiction only. [8 Wigmore, <italic>supra</italic>, § <cross_reference>2389</cross_reference>(4), pp 860-861. Emphasis in the original.]</block_quote>

I see no reason to conclude that this rule should not apply equally to former proceedings in the same trial as well as to former trials.<footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference> Thus, a failure by the holder to assert the privilege by objection at the preliminary examination in the same case is a waiver of the privilege.<footnote_reference>[fn14]</footnote_reference>

The confidential communication privilege acts to hold inviolate the privacy of the marital relationship. When facts which might otherwise be privileged are disclosed for all to inspect, the purpose of the privilege is destroyed. Just as one cannot unring a bell, a secret once disclosed in open court is never again a wholly private matter.<footnote_reference>[fn15]</footnote_reference><page_number>Page 195</page_number>

<center>                                   III</center>
Finally, even if it was error to admit the testimony,<page_number>Page 196</page_number>
the defendant's wife would be considered unavailable as a witness due to defendant's assertion of the spousal privilege.<footnote_reference>[fn16]</footnote_reference> As such, her testimony at the preliminary examination, to which defendant failed to object, should be received under MRE 804(b)(1), which provides an exception to the hearsay rule for "[t]estimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding. . . ."

This Court has recognized the admissibility of such prior testimony even though testimony at trial was precluded by defendant's assertion of the spousal privilege. For example, in<italic>People v Love, supra</italic>, p 708, Justice CAVANAGH indicated that if the witness spouse "voluntarily testified at the [preliminary] examination, her recorded testimony would have been admissible at trial as substantive evidence pursuant to MRE 804(b)(1)," even though she had been precluded from testifying at trial because of the spousal privilege. (Opinion of CAVANAGH, J., with LEVIN, J., concurring.) See also <italic>People v Whalen</italic>, <cross_reference>129 Mich. App. 732</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>738</cross_reference>;<cross_reference>342 N.W.2d 917</cross_reference> (1983) ("Consequently, . . . if the spouse testified at the preliminary examination . . . while<page_number>Page 197</page_number>
married to the defendant and the marital privilege was not properly asserted, the preliminary examination testimony is admissible at trial when the marital privilege is asserted by the defendant").

CONCLUSION

The Court of Appeals erred in reversing the conviction because the exceptions listed in § 2162, more specifically the exception concerning crimes against the children of either or both, apply to the communications privilege.

RILEY, C.J., and GRIFFIN, J., concurred with BOYLE, J.

(1986). They do not require such testimony.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> Early Michigan statutes contained such a form of spousal disqualification. See 1857 CL 4339:

<block_quote>    <italic>No person shall be excluded from giving evidence</italic> <italic>in any matter, suit or proceeding, civil or</italic> <italic>criminal</italic>, by reason of crime, or of any interest of such person in the matter in question, or in the event of the suit or proceeding in which his testimony may be offered, unless such person be individually a party, named in the record, to such matter, suit or proceeding, or unless such matter, suit or proceeding be prosecuted or defended, either wholly or in part, in the immediate and individual behalf of such person, or <italic>unless such person be the</italic> <italic>husband or wife of such party;</italic> but when such person is a party, he may be a witness under the rules prescribed by statute. [Emphasis added.]</block_quote></footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> See <cross_reference>1861 PA 125</cross_reference>, § 4342:

<block_quote>    A husband shall not be examined as a witness for or against his wife, without her consent, nor a wife for or against her husband, without his consent; nor shall either, during the marriage or afterwards, be, without the consent of both, examined as to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage; but in any action or proceedings instituted by the husband or wife in consequence of adultery, the husband and wife shall not be competent to testify.</block_quote></footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn5]</footnote_number> In addition to this often quoted justification, one commentator has identified three additional grounds for the continued life of the marital privileges. The privileges are sometimes said to promote individual rights by allowing the protection of the right to privacy. The contempt power of the court is viewed as an intrusive force, and one spouse is allowed to shield the other from having to choose between loyalty to the state and loyalty to one's spouse. This view is criticized by those who would observe that in such a case the privilege is better vested with the witness because too often valuable evidence is lost when one spouse would voluntarily testify against the other.

Similarly, the marital privileges are justified on the ground that by avoiding the situation whereby a court is forced to compel one spouse to testify against the other, the public's perception of the judicial system is enhanced. Critics respond, however, that this argument assumes popular awareness of the law and could work to denigrate the public's perception of the system when a defendant-spouse avoids prosecution by preventing a willing spouse from testifying.

A final explanation of the privileges is that they perpetuate the role of male domination in the marriage. It is claimed that because the privileges are more often invoked by a husband to bar the testimony of his wife, the privileges will benefit men more often than women and will serve to legitimize and solidify social perceptions of the marriage status quo and reinforce the subordinate view of women historically rooted in the male domination of the marital relationship. This view assumes popular knowledge of the marital privilege.</footnote_body>

relied upon <italic>Grattan v Metropolitan Life Ins Co</italic>, <cross_reference>92 N.Y. 274</cross_reference>; 44 AR 372 (1883), which had already been overruled by <italic>McKinney v</italic><italic>Grand Street, PP  FR Co</italic>, <cross_reference>104 N.Y. 352</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>10 N.E. 544</cross_reference> (1887). It was perhaps overly generous of the <italic>Briesenmeister</italic> Court to characterize <italic>Grattan</italic> as "overruled" in that the recapture of privilege theory mentioned in <italic>Grattan</italic> was merely an alternative ground for the court's conclusion that the evidence was admissible. As the <italic>Grattan</italic> court initially explained:

<block_quote>    [T]he evidence was inadmissible for two reasons. What the witness testified to on a former trial, he being living and present for examination on the second trial, could only be proved for the purpose of contradicting him or of refreshing his memory. No emergency of that kind existed to justify proof. [<italic>Id.</italic>, p 287.]</block_quote>

As the <italic>McKinney</italic> court later acknowledged, no authority was provided in <italic>Grattan</italic> for the alternative ground of privilege by which the evidence was excluded.

Furthermore, <italic>Briesenmeister</italic>, like <italic>Grattan</italic>, involved the testimony of the treating physician of the deceased in an action upon a life insurance policy in which the insurer claimed forfeiture by fraudulent statement of health on the part of the insured. The error alleged in <italic>Briesenmeister</italic> was the exclusion of certain evidence alleged to be privileged only <italic>after</italic> its admission. The Court agreed that the trial court erred in striking at least portions of the testimony, given that the objection was late, and reversed for a new trial. However, the<italic>Briesenmeister</italic> Court suggested that the privilege might be reasserted at the new trial.

In my view, <italic>Briesenmeister</italic> does not control in this case. Given the substantial changes in this reasoning behind the continued existence of statutory privileges such as the spousal bar in the nearly one hundred years since <italic>Briesenmeister</italic> was decided, the fact that the Court's discussion in that case of the recapture of a privilege was clearly <italic>dictum</italic> and the lack of authority for its conclusion, I find <italic>Briesenmeister</italic>
unpersuasive. To the extent that <italic>Briesenmeister</italic> has any precedential value, it is narrow indeed and has no application on these facts.

The two cases cited by Justice LEVIN in his separate opinion,<italic>Burgess v Sims Drug Co</italic>, <cross_reference>114 Iowa 275</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>86 N.W. 307</cross_reference> (1901), and<italic>Maryland Casualty Co v Maloney</italic>, <cross_reference>119 Ark. 434</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>178 S.W. 387</cross_reference> (1915), do stand for the proposition that a waiver does not necessarily preclude reassertion of a privilege at a subsequent proceeding. However, I question their dispositiveness in light of the fact that the great weight of more recent authority supports the opposite conclusion. See, e.g., <italic>Cerro Gordo Charity v</italic><italic>Fireman's Fund American Life Ins</italic>, <cross_reference>819 F.2d 1471</cross_reference> (CA 8, 1987);<italic>State v Bishop</italic>, <cross_reference>187 N.J. Super. 187</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>435 A.2d 1365</cross_reference> (1982); <italic>State v</italic><italic>Mincey, supra.</italic></footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn16]</footnote_number> The majority reaches the conclusion that the prosecution waived the waiver argument as well as the prosecution's alternative argument that defendant's wife's prior recorded testimony at the preliminary examination would have been admissible under MRE 804(b)(1) had she been precluded from testifying at trial by defendant's invocation of the spousal privilege, since she would then have to be deemed unavailable as a witness. MRE 804(a)(1) defines "unavailability as a witness" to include situations in which the declarant "is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of [the] statement. . . ."

I would conclude that the prosecution is not precluded from advancing either argument by its failure to assert that argument prior to filing its brief with this Court. Prior to the decision of the Court of Appeals on remand, the prosecution, as appellee, was not required to present any particular arguments in support of the prior decisions in its favor. Only when it became the appellant before this Court was it required to raise such arguments which it has, in fact, done.</footnote_body><page_number>Page 198</page_number>
