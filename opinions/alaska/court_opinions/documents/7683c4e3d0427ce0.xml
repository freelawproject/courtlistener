<opinion_text>  Based upon his pleas of no contest, Louis D. Hastings was convicted of six counts of first-degree murder, and two counts of attempted murder.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> This court affirmed Hastings's convictions on appeal.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> Hastings then filed an application for post-conviction relief arguing that his trial attorney provided him with ineffective assistance. Specifically, Hastings claimed that his trial attorney did not adequately investigate nor adequately inform him about raising an insanity defense based on Hastings's exposure to copper in McCarthy. Hastings claimed that he would not have entered his no contest plea had his attorney adequately investigated and informed him about this defense. Superior Court Judge pro tem Joel H. Bolger dismissed Hastings's application on the ground that Hastings failed to state a prima facie case. Hastings appeals this decision. We conclude that Judge Bolger was correct in ruling that Hastings did not present any evidence that his attorney's decisions were ineffective. We accordingly affirm Judge Bolger's order dismissing Hastings's application for post-conviction relief.

<italic>Factual and procedural background</italic>

Hastings's convictions arose from his attempt to kill all the residents of the small town of McCarthy in 1983.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> The influx of money and people to Alaska disturbed Hastings. He decided to end these trends by disrupting the flow of oil through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Having decided to blow up a pump station on the pipeline, Hastings concluded that it was necessary to kill all of McCarthy's residents to eliminate them as possible witnesses. In preparation for his plan, Hastings accumulated several firearms and at least 2,000 rounds of ammunition. He also manufactured a silencer for a pistol he intended to use. On March 1, 1983, as McCarthy's townspeople prepared to meet the weekly mail plane, Hastings systematically began killing them. He succeeded in killing six people and wounding two others. One victim escaped, after she was wounded, by eluding Hastings as he searched for her. The other surviving victim was able to escape by plane and alert state troopers. The troopers flew into McCarthy and captured Hastings as he attempted to escape on a snowmachine belonging to one of his victims.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

Hastings pleaded no contest to the multiple charges of murder and attempted murder, while preserving the right to present psychiatric evidence that he had been guilty but mentally ill at the time of the offense.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> A three-day hearing was held on the question of whether Hastings should be found guilty but mentally ill.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> Hastings presented one witness, Dr. Joseph Satten, a psychiatrist. The State presented two witnesses, Dr. David J. Coons and Dr. Irvin Rothrock — both psychiatrists.

Both Dr. Rothrock and Dr. Coons testified that Hastings had the ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. They testified that he did not suffer from any mental disease or defect which prevented him from forming the intent to kill.

Dr. Satten, Hastings's witness, testified that he did not believe that Hastings appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct. Dr. Satten concluded that Hastings knew what he was doing, however, emotionally Hastings did not comprehend or appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions. Dr. Satten did believe that Hastings probably had the ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.

After hearing testimony from all three witnesses, as well as arguments from counsel, Superior Court Judge Ralph E. Moody found that Hastings had not established that he was guilty but mentally ill. This court affirmed Judge Moody's ruling on appeal.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>

After much delay, in 1996 Hastings filed an application for post-conviction relief stating that his plea of no contest was defective, arguing:

<block_quote>  because I was denied the effective assistance of counsel because my attorney failed to correctly advise me of the results and progress of [the]investigation into a heavy-metal-induced-psychosis-based defense; instead falsely leading me to believe that this line of inquiry was completely hopeless, and such failure on the part of counsel caused me to enter pleas of no contest.</block_quote>

According to Hastings's application, during the change of plea hearing, Hastings and John B. Salemi, Hastings's trial attorney, informed the court that they had discussed the possibility of proceeding to trial using psychiatric defenses. Salemi had tests done on Hastings's blood and hair. The hair samples showed abnormally high levels of copper and showed depressed lithium levels. There is a correlation between high levels of copper in the body and violent behavior. Salemi advised Hastings that if this theory was developed, it could form the basis for a defense. According to Hastings, as the trial date approached, Salemi "had not received any response from the experts who had been contacted that was positive enough to merit the request for continuance." Consequently, Hastings pleaded no contest to the charges. (Hastings stated that he decided to plead no contest to spare his family the trauma of being involved in the case.)

Hastings obtained Salemi's affidavit to support his application for post-conviction relief. Salemi stated that he had reviewed the record in the case, including his prior testimony, and "[n]othing I have reviewed has made my recollection of this matter any clearer in my mind than at the time I testified [before the superior court]."

Salemi had previously stated that he had various psychiatrists evaluate Hastings and after discussing any psychiatric defenses, concluded that none would be successful. Salemi explained that he did not put much weight on the current elevated copper levels because Hastings had suicidal ideations, was violent and had had psychiatric problems his entire life. Salemi concluded that the "real problem with asserting that the copper toxicity theory had any impact on what happened in McCarthy was the fact that Mr. Hastings before he was exposed to copper had been planning this offense[.]" (Hastings's own psychiatrist stated that Hastings had been planning the homicides two years before they took place. Hastings had moved to McCarthy in the summer of 1982. The crime took place in 1983.) Salemi noted that just before and immediately after the criminal acts took place Hastings was not acting bizarre or violent and had a firm grasp of reality.

According to Salemi's affidavit, "Hastings always described his criminal acts as an outgrowth of the meaninglessness of life, the non-contingent nature of human life, and his need to both do away with his own life, and at the same time make a statement/difference." Salemi recalled that:

<block_quote>  Mr. Hastings never exhibited bizarre behavior, or even bizarre thinking, other than the thinking that was associated with and used to explain his grand scheme to kill the entire population of McCarthy, blow up the Trans-Alaska pipeline, and kill himself in the process. Put another way, when discussing legal issues as attorney to client, Mr. Hastings was rational, logical and even reasonable in his approach. Similarly, when engaged in general conversation with Mr. Hastings, he was always socially appropriate, reality-based, and rational. If he were suffering from some form of heavy metal toxicity it seems it would have been exhibited in his thinking or behavior during our first meetings (which occurred within a couple of days of the criminal conduct in McCarthy).</block_quote>

While Salemi could not recall the specific details concerning the efforts to establish a link between Hastings's criminal conduct and heavy metal toxicity, he did have Hastings's hair tested, and these test results, along with "virtually everything concerning the case," were provided to the psychiatrists. Salemi did remember that Hastings's "planning of the McCarthy events predated his exposure to the lead dust, copper, etc." Salemi stated that he and the team of forensic psychologists "could find nothing upon which to support a legal or factual defense." Salemi explained that he could not "recall specific conversations with Mr. Hastings that may have occurred concerning a continuance of the trial," but he did "recall that Mr. Hastings was very concerned about a woman friend down in the Bay Area . . . who had been subpoenaed to testify. . . . Hastings's concern was so great that he indicated he would waive his right to a trial if that's what it would take to prevent the State from bringing this witness to Alaska."

Hastings also supplemented his application for post-conviction relief with the affidavits from himself, and two psychiatric experts, Dr. Robert Thatcher, a professor at the Applied Neuroscience Laboratories at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and Dr. Alexander Schauss, the director of the American Institute for Biosocial Research, Inc. Dr. Thatcher stated, "If it had been possible to extrapolate higher copper levels in Mr. Hastings at the time of his crimes, scientifically, this would have strengthened a conclusion that his behavior was affected by copper toxicity." Dr. Schauss stated that based on the higher than normal levels of copper in Hastings's body, "[I]t was my opinion that there were reasonable ground[s] to develop several defenses for [Hastings]." Hastings affied that beginning in 1982 he had been exposed to copper from a preservative put on the logs in his cabin, and from drinking water from streams in Kennicott that were near extensive copper mining operations. Hastings stated that had he known that experts might have been able to use the current elevated levels of copper in his body to extrapolate the levels in his body when he committed the homicides, and further had he known that expert analysis might have led to a possible defense, he would not have entered a plea of no contest.

After numerous procedural delays, Judge Bolger ruled on Hastings's application for post-conviction relief. Judge Bolger concluded that Hastings's application had adequately alleged that the information Salemi disregarded about the metal-psychosis defense could have affected Hastings's decision to plead no contest. But, Judge Bolger also concluded that Hastings failed "to allege facts ruling out the possibility that Salemi made a sound tactical choice when he abandoned the metal-psychosis defense." Consequently, Judge Bolger dismissed Hastings's application because Hastings failed to set forth a prima facie case for relief.

<block_quote>  <italic>Judge Bolger did not err in dismissing Hastings's application</italic> <italic>for failure to state a prima facie case</italic></block_quote>

In order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that his counsel did not perform as well as a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> The defendant must also show that he was prejudiced: he must create a reasonable doubt that the attorney's ineffectiveness hurt him.<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference>

The decision about what plea to enter is one of those fundamental decisions that is ultimately up to the defendant, not to the attorney.<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference> Of course the defendant is entitled to competent advice from the attorney and the attorney's failure to properly advise a client about the potential viability of a defense may amount to ineffective assistance of counsel which would authorize the defendant to withdraw his plea.<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference> But to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, where the attorney makes a tactical decision, the defendant must overcome the presumption of competence and show that no effective counsel would have provided him with similar advice.<footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference>

Our review of Hastings's application shows that he failed to plead a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel. The record shows that the attorney investigated the possibility of proceeding with a copper toxicity defense. However, the attorney alleged that he did not do further investigation and abandoned the defense because it did not fit the facts of the case. Salemi pointed out that a major problem with the defense was that Hastings had been planning the homicides long before he was exposed to the copper. Thus, Salemi made a tactical decision and Hastings had the duty to overcome the presumption that Salemi acted competently — that no effective attorney would have proceeded as Salemi did. Hastings did not allege any basis for finding that Salemi's tactical decisions were unreasonable. Therefore, Hastings did not set out a prima facie case because he failed to demonstrate that his attorney's performance was deficient.<footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference>

Hastings makes numerous arguments that Judge Bolger erred in not allowing the case to go forward with discovery and hearings, and instead ruling on the State's motion to dismiss on the ground that Hastings's application was deficient for failing to state a prima facie claim for relief. But the Alaska Supreme Court expressly directed Judge Bolger to evaluate the application on its face to determine whether Hastings had established a prima facie case before allowing the case to proceed with discovery.<footnote_reference>[fn14]</footnote_reference> Therefore, Judge Bolger did not err in following the supreme court directive to determine whether Hastings had established a prima facie case.

<italic>Conclusion</italic>

We conclude that Judge Bolger did not err in concluding that Hastings's application did not establish a prima facie case for relief. Therefore, Judge Bolger did not err in dismissing Hastings's application.
