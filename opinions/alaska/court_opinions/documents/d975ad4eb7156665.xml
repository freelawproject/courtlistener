</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Eugene F. Bottcher attacks several aspects of the sentence imposed following his plea of no contest to failure to render assistance to an injured person after<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
an accident, manslaughter, and third-degree assault.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The superior court imposed a composite 20-year term to serve.

Bottcher contends that the 20-year sentence and his lifetime driver's license revocation are excessive, that the court erred in concluding that he was a worst offender, and that a special condition of probation must be vacated. Because we conclude that the superior court's sentencing comments are insufficient to explain the 20-year term to serve and the lifetime driver's license revocation, we remand Bottcher's case to the superior court.

<italic>Background facts and proceedings</italic>

On May 23, 2005, outside of Fairbanks, Bottcher drove his vehicle off Goldstream Road and crashed into 13-year-old Saul Stutz, who was on his bicycle waiting to cross at an intersection. Stutz was mortally injured. In addition, Bottcher nearly hit Stutz's nine-year-old brother who was nearby. Bottcher drove away without stopping.

Stutz was taken to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital and then transferred to Anchorage. He died about a day later.

When the State later obtained a breath test from Bottcher, he had a blood alcohol level of .237. Witnesses who saw Bottcher drinking heavily at local bars before the crash confirmed that Bottcher was intoxicated.

Dale Pomraning was driving in the other direction at the scene of the crash and saw Bottcher leave the scene after he ran down Stutz. Pomraning stopped briefly to check on the boys, and then he chased after Bottcher, driving "flat out." Eventually he<page_number>Page 3</page_number>
caught up to Bottcher, who was behind two other vehicles. Pomraning passed Bottcher, pulled in front of him, and eventually stopped him by gradually slowing down. Pomraning then confronted Bottcher, telling Bottcher that he had run down a boy and insisting that Bottcher return to the scene. Bottcher agreed to return, but he again drove further away from the scene.

Once again, Pomraning gave chase, and followed Bottcher for several miles to Bottcher's home. W hen Pomraning again confronted Bottcher, Bottcher offered a wad of cash to Pomraning, twice telling Pomraning, "Aw, forget it." Bottcher admitted he was drunk, and went inside his home.

Pomraning blocked Bottcher's vehicle with his own, walked to a nearby house, and contacted the state troopers. The troopers arrived shortly thereafter and arrested Bottcher.

Bottcher had no prior convictions for driving under the influence but had a 40-year history of alcohol dependence. He admitted that he routinely drove when he was intoxicated.

The grand jury indicted Bottcher for failing to render assistance to an injured person after an accident, manslaughter, third-degree assault, and interference with official proceedings.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

The parties reached a plea agreement. Bottcher agreed to plead no contest to failure to render assistance, manslaughter, and third-degree assault, and the State agreed to dismiss the charge of interference with official proceedings and a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> There was no agreement regarding the sentence.<page_number>Page 4</page_number>

Superior Court Judge Charles R. Pengilly rejected the State's proposed statutory aggravating factors and Bottcher's proposed statutory mitigating factors.

Judge Pengilly found that Bottcher acted with extreme indifference to the value of Stutz's life. Judge Pengilly found that Bottcher was a worst offender and deserved the most severe sentence the court was authorized to impose. The judge imposed 20 years with 9 suspended for manslaughter, 5 years with 3 suspended for third-degree assault, and 10 years with 3 suspended for failure to render assistance, with each sentence consecutive to the other. Thus, Judge Pengilly imposed a composite 35-year term with 15 years suspended, a net 20-year term to serve. Judge Pengilly also revoked Bottcher's driver's license for the remainder of his life and imposed a special condition of probation barring Bottcher from riding in the front seat of any vehicle.

After Bottcher filed his opening brief, the State filed a motion with this court, conceding that Judge Pengilly exceeded his sentencing authority. The State pointed out that the court imposed a sentence in excess of the presumptive sentencing range for manslaughter and third-degree assault without finding a statutory aggravating factor, and asked that the case be remanded to the superior court for resentencing. In response, this court issued an order remanding the case, and Superior Court Judge Mark I. Wood accepted the State's concession of error. Judge Wood modified Bottcher's sentence by eliminating all of his suspended time for manslaughter and third-degree assault, but left the rest of his sentence unchanged. Thus, Bottcher's sentence is a composite 23-year term with 3 years suspended, a net 20-year term to serve.<page_number>Page 5</page_number>
 <italic>The challenge to the probation condition</italic>

Bottcher challenges the probation condition that requires him not to "operate or be in the front seat of any motor vehicle." This condition apparently followed the recommendation in the presentence report:

<block_quote>  [A] court order barring the defendant from operating any motor vehicle will also be recommended. . . . To preclude even the appearance of driving, . . . the Court might wish to take the additional protective measure of prohibiting the defendant from being in the front seat of any motor vehicle.</block_quote>

Bottcher did not challenge this recommendation at sentencing. In fact, with only a few suggested modifications not pertinent to this issue, Bottcher urged the court to adopt the recommendations of the presentence report.

Bottcher does not now argue that the restriction on driving while his license is revoked is erroneous. Instead, he argues that barring him from being a front-seat passenger is not reasonably related to either his rehabilitation or the protection of the public, and is unduly restrictive of his liberty.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

Bottcher had problems with alcohol throughout his adult life. Even though he understood the risks involved, he had repeatedly driven while under its influence. In this case, after he ran Stutz down, he fled the scene and did not return, even after he was chased down and stopped. When Pomraning followed Bottcher to his house, Bottcher tried to bribe him. Thus, Bottcher demonstrated an ingrained pattern of risky behavior, and when his behavior led to fatal consequences, he resorted to additional crimes in an attempt to avoid responsibility. In these circumstances, a reasonable judge could<page_number>Page 6</page_number>
conclude that keeping Bottcher out of reach of the driver's seat of a vehicle was reasonably related to the protection of the public and was not unduly restrictive of Bottcher's liberty.

<italic>The life-long driver's license revocation</italic>

Bottcher was sixty-two years old at sentencing when Judge Pengilly revoked Bottcher's driver's license for life.

Because Bottcher was convicted of manslaughter, failing to render assistance, and assault, all involving the use of his vehicle, Judge Pengilly had the authority under AS <cross_reference>28.15.181</cross_reference> to revoke Bottcher's license as a direct component of his sentence.

In <italic>Dodge v. Anchorage</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> we ruled that a sentencing judge exercising the authority to revoke a driver's license provided in AS <cross_reference>28.15.181</cross_reference> should impose a lifetime revocation "only in extreme cases when the court concludes that such a revocation is required to protect the public."<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> As we discussed above, Bottcher had problems with alcohol dependence throughout his adult life. He often drove when he was under the influence — even when he understood the risks of that conduct. Bottcher was not a youthful offender, but was in his early sixties when he drove off the road and crashed into Stutz. His conduct after the collision demonstrated that he would resort to further criminality to avoid responsibility. And when he was tested, his breath alcohol level of .237 percent was almost three times the legal limit.<page_number>Page 7</page_number>

But Judge Pengilly made no findings to support his decision to revoke Bottcher's driver's license. When the judge addressed the issue, he stated as follows: "I hope I do not have to explain why I am going to revoke Mr. Bottcher's license for life. I do not think that requires any explanation or any further development." We conclude that the judge's terse comment does not satisfy <italic>Dodge</italic>. Accordingly, we vacate the lifetime driver's license revocation.

<italic>Bottcher's attack on the worst offender finding</italic>

Judge Pengilly classified Bottcher as a worst offender for the manslaughter conviction based on his analysis of Bottcher's conduct in this case.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> Normally, a sentencing court must find that a defendant is a worst offender before imposing the maximum term for an offense.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference>

Bottcher argues that the court's worst offender finding is not supported by the record. But the superior court did not impose the maximum term for manslaughter. Instead, the court imposed an 11-year term, the upper limit of the presumptive range for this count.<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference> Because the superior court was authorized to impose this term without the necessity of a worst offender finding, Bottcher's argument is moot.

<italic>Bottcher's excessive sentence claim</italic>

Bottcher received a net 20-year term to serve for his three convictions. Bottcher argues that this term is excessive for his conduct, and is clearly mistaken when<page_number>Page 8</page_number>
compared with other vehicular homicide cases, even those where the defendants were convicted of second-degree murder. To evaluate this claim, we consider Bottcher's recklessness, the consequences of his conduct, his age, his criminal record, and his history of alcohol abuse.<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference>

The presentence report showed that Bottcher did not have a driving record. He committed a felony cocaine offense in 1977, but had no other criminal history. Bottcher was sixty-two years of age at sentencing. Bottcher's recklessness was very high; Bottcher's tested alcohol level was .237 percent. He inexplicably left the roadway, struck and fatally injured Stutz, and almost struck Stutz's younger brother. He returned to the roadway and sped away, completely indifferent to the fate of his victim. Although stopped and confronted twice by Pomraning, Bottcher chose to avoid responsibility, and ultimately, in the face of Pomraning's insistence that Bottcher return to the scene, Bottcher tried to bribe Pomraning to "forget it."

Nevertheless, Bottcher's composite sentence exceeds the sentence imposed in other reported cases of vehicular homicide caused by a defendant who was driving under the influence.

In <italic>Gullard v. State</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference> the Alaska Supreme Court upheld a 10-year sentence for a nineteen-year-old defendant who drove while intoxicated, killed four people, and was convicted of a single consolidated count of manslaughter under the former criminal code.<footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference><page_number>Page 9</page_number>

In <italic>Sandvik v. State</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference> the defendant was driving while intoxicated when he left the road and struck and killed a bicyclist who was cycling alongside the highway.<footnote_reference>[fn14]</footnote_reference> Sandvik was forty-years old and had a lifelong alcohol problem.<footnote_reference>[fn15]</footnote_reference> Sandvik had six convictions for driving while intoxicated, and he was pending trial on two additional driving-while-intoxicated charges at the time of the homicide.<footnote_reference>[fn16]</footnote_reference> The supreme court thus concluded that Sandvik's 12-year term to serve was not clearly mistaken.<footnote_reference>[fn17]</footnote_reference>

In <italic>Rosendahl v. State</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn18]</footnote_reference> the supreme court affirmed a composite 10-year term imposed for manslaughter under the former criminal code and failure to render assistance for a defendant who drove while intoxicated and killed one person.<footnote_reference>[fn19]</footnote_reference> Rosendahl had two prior convictions for driving while intoxicated, as well as five speeding convictions.<footnote_reference>[fn20]</footnote_reference><page_number>Page 10</page_number>

In <italic>State v. Dunlop</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn21]</footnote_reference> the supreme court affirmed Dunlop's composite 10-year term imposed by the superior court on two counts of manslaughter.<footnote_reference>[fn22]</footnote_reference> Dunlop struck and killed two pedestrians while driving when he was extremely intoxicated.<footnote_reference>[fn23]</footnote_reference>

In <italic>Barney v. State</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn24]</footnote_reference> this court upheld a 10-year term to serve for manslaughter and second-degree assault under Alaska's current criminal code.<footnote_reference>[fn25]</footnote_reference> Barney was speeding, drove through a red light, and struck another car — killing the driver and seriously injuring the passenger.<footnote_reference>[fn26]</footnote_reference> Barney was twenty-six-years old, had an extensive traffic record, but no felony convictions.<footnote_reference>[fn27]</footnote_reference>

In <italic>Ratliff v. State</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn28]</footnote_reference> this court affirmed the defendant's 10-year term for second-degree murder.<footnote_reference>[fn29]</footnote_reference> After drinking alcoholic beverages and smoking marijuana, Ratliff drove on the wrong side of a divided highway and collided with another car, killing the driver.<footnote_reference>[fn30]</footnote_reference><page_number>Page 11</page_number>

In <italic>Puzewicz v. State</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn31]</footnote_reference> this court affirmed the defendant's composite 13-year term to serve for his conviction on two counts of second-degree murder for driving while intoxicated, crossing the center line and striking an oncoming car, killing the driver and one passenger, and seriously injuring three other passengers.<footnote_reference>[fn32]</footnote_reference> Puzewicz had three prior convictions for driving while intoxicated, had been driving on a suspended license, and had a blood alcohol level of .219.<footnote_reference>[fn33]</footnote_reference>

In <italic>Pusich v. State</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn34]</footnote_reference> we upheld a 25-year term with 7 years suspended, a net 18-year term to serve.<footnote_reference>[fn35]</footnote_reference> Pusich was convicted of one count of manslaughter and one count of first-degree assault for killing three people and seriously injuring a fourth.<footnote_reference>[fn36]</footnote_reference> Pusich had an extensive history of driving while intoxicated and had failed at alcohol treatment.<footnote_reference>[fn37]</footnote_reference> The superior court found that Pusich's recklessness bordered on the extreme recklessness required for extreme indifference second-degree murder.<footnote_reference>[fn38]</footnote_reference>

In <italic>Foxglove v. State</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn39]</footnote_reference> we upheld a sentence of 25 years with 6 years suspended, a net 19-year term to serve, based on Foxglove's convictions for<page_number>Page 12</page_number>
manslaughter and five counts of first-degree assault.<footnote_reference>[fn40]</footnote_reference> Foxglove seriously injured a boy while driving his snowmobile at high speeds while intoxicated.<footnote_reference>[fn41]</footnote_reference> Even though Foxglove was warned that he was too intoxicated to drive after he injured his first victim, about half an hour later, Foxglove intentionally drove his snowmobile at seventy miles per hour into a crowd of people gathered around a bonfire, killing one victim and seriously injuring several others.<footnote_reference>[fn42]</footnote_reference>

In <italic>Doshier v. State</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn43]</footnote_reference> an unpublished case, we upheld the net 19-year term to serve for one count of manslaughter and one count of second-degree assault.<footnote_reference>[fn44]</footnote_reference> Doshier was driving under the influence (she had a blood alcohol level of .353 percent) when she rear-ended a vehicle stopped at an intersection, killing one person and seriously injuring another.<footnote_reference>[fn45]</footnote_reference> Doshier was a first felony offender with two prior convictions for driving while intoxicated.<footnote_reference>[fn46]</footnote_reference> After a sentence appeal, the superior court imposed a composite 20-year term with 8 years suspended.<footnote_reference>[fn47]</footnote_reference> While Doshier was on probation, she was convicted of driving under the influence.<footnote_reference>[fn48]</footnote_reference> The superior court then<page_number>Page 13</page_number>
revoked Doshier's probation and imposed 7 y ears of Doshier's suspended imprisonment, resulting in the net 19-year term to serve.<footnote_reference>[fn49]</footnote_reference>

In <italic>Tice v. State</italic>, <footnote_reference>[fn50]</footnote_reference> we upheld a composite 25-year term for one count of manslaughter and one count of first-degree assault arising out of a case of vehicular manslaughter.<footnote_reference>[fn51]</footnote_reference> Tice lost control of the vehicle he was driving and crashed.<footnote_reference>[fn52]</footnote_reference> Two children and their mother were passengers in his vehicle.<footnote_reference>[fn53]</footnote_reference> One child died as a result of the crash and the other was injured.<footnote_reference>[fn54]</footnote_reference> Tice pressured the mother to falsely take responsibility for the crash, which she did for about one year.<footnote_reference>[fn55]</footnote_reference> Tice was a third felony offender for purposes of presumptive sentencing and faced a 15-year presumptive term under the pre-March 2005 sentencing code for manslaughter and assault.<footnote_reference>[fn56]</footnote_reference> Tice also had a prior conviction for driving under the influence and, according to the sentencing judge, had "a long and difficult criminal history."<footnote_reference>[fn57]</footnote_reference>

Admittedly, since most of these reported decisions were issued, the legislature has amended the sentencing code to increase the minimum term for a<page_number>Page 14</page_number>
vehicular homicide charged as second-degree murder to 10 years' imprisonment, <footnote_reference>[fn58]</footnote_reference> and to increase the presumptive sentencing range for a first felony offender convicted of manslaughter to 7 to 11 years' imprisonment.<footnote_reference>[fn59]</footnote_reference>

Alaska Statute <cross_reference>12.55.005</cross_reference>(1) provides that a sentencing court should consider the seriousness of the defendant's offense in relation to other offenses.<footnote_reference>[fn60]</footnote_reference> Judge Pengilly imposed a term to serve for a first felony offender convicted of manslaughter involving a vehicular homicide exceeding the cases we discussed above. But the judge did not compare Bottcher's case to these reported cases to justify the composite term. The court's findings, standing alone, do not justify this term.

Because Judge Pengilly is now retired, we cannot remand the case for him to enter additional findings. Because the case must be reassigned to another judge, we must vacate Bottcher's sentence and remand for resentencing.

<italic>Conclusion</italic>

We VACATE Bottcher's sentence and REMAND the case to the superior court for resentencing.
