<opinion_text><unpublished>  Miguel de la Rosa<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> challenges his two convictions for the unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. He argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his uncharged contacts with an undercover officer in violation of ER 404(b), in rejecting his `to convict' instruction, and in failing to provide a timely trial. We affirm.

<center>                                   FACTS</center>
On February 5, 1998, undercover officer Darr Kirk of the Cowlitz/Wahkiakum Narcotics Task Force approached a blue Toyota sedan. De la Rosa was in the driver's seat and a woman named Victoria was in the passenger seat. After Kirk spoke with Victoria, de la Rosa motioned him inside. Kirk complied and spoke with de la Rosa for several minutes.

On February 19, Kirk again contacted Victoria at the same location. As he drove her to a nearby McDonalds, he handed her $2,200 to count. When they got out of the car, de la Rosa approached them. Kirk asked if a fourth individual, a woman he did not know, was `okay.' Report of Proceedings (RP) at 28. De la Rosa responded: `She knows what's going on. She's all right.' RP at 28.

Kirk and de la Rosa spoke about future heroin buys. De la Rosa then pulled four round, marble-sized balls wrapped in black tape from his front pocket and handed them to Kirk. Later testing showed that the balls contained heroin.

The next day, February 20, de la Rosa paged Kirk to apologize for `shorting' him on the amount of heroin he had delivered the previous day. By arrangement, they met in Portland later that day so that de la Rosa could deliver the remaining heroin, about one-quarter ounce. De la Rosa again explained the mistake and gave Kirk an object packaged in tape.

On February 26, 1998, Kirk called de la Rosa to arrange for another buy. When they met the next day, de la Rosa was nervous and he asked Kirk if he was a police officer. Despite his concerns, he eventually gave Kirk a duct-taped package containing almost five ounces of heroin in exchange for $5,000.

On February 26, 1999, the State filed a two-count information charging de la Rosa with the unlawful delivery of a controlled substance on February 19 and on February 27, 1998. The defendant's information sheet listed de la Rosa's address as `unknown' and the superior court issued an arrest warrant. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 2.

The police arrested de la Rosa on May 5, 1999; he made his first appearance in court on that date and he was arraigned on May 13, 1999, with no objection noted on the record. After signing five waivers of his right to a speedy trial, de la Rosa alleged a speedy trial violation and moved to dismiss the charges. The trial court denied the motion and de la Rosa subsequently signed five more speedy trial waivers. De la Rosa's February 2000 trial ended in a mistrial but following a retrial, a jury found him guilty as charged.

<center>                                 DISCUSSION</center><center>                           I. ER 404(b) Evidence</center>
De la Rosa contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the February 5 and February 20 contacts, contending that this evidence violated ER 404(b).

We review the trial court's evidentiary decisions for an abuse of discretion. State v. Wade, <cross_reference>138 Wn.2d 460</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>463-64</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>979 P.2d 850</cross_reference> (1999). Under ER 404(b), `[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.' Such evidence may be admissible for other purposes, however, including `proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.' ER 404(b).

Under ER 404(b), evidence of other acts may be admissible if (1) the State proves the conduct by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) the evidence is logically relevant to a material issue; and (3) its probative value outweighs its potential for unfair prejudice. State v. Pirtle,<cross_reference>127 Wn.2d 628</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>648-49</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>904 P.2d 245</cross_reference> (1995); State v. Saltarelli,<cross_reference>98 Wn.2d 358</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>362-63</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>655 P.2d 697</cross_reference> (1982) (evidence is relevant if it is of consequence to the outcome of the action and it makes the existence of the identified fact more or less probable).

The trial court should balance the probative value of the evidence against its potential for unfair prejudice on the record; failure to do so is error. State v. Jackson, <cross_reference>102 Wn.2d 689</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>693-94</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>689 P.2d 76</cross_reference>
(1984). But evidentiary errors under ER 404 are not of constitutional magnitude. Jackson, <cross_reference>102 Wn.2d at 695</cross_reference>. Thus, the failure to balance on the record is not reversible error absent prejudice. State v. Smith,<cross_reference>106 Wn.2d 772</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>780</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>725 P.2d 951</cross_reference> (1986). The failure to balance on the record may be harmless if we can determine from the record that the trial court would have admitted the evidence had it performed the balancing test, or if excluding the evidence would not have changed the trial's outcome. State v. Carleton, <cross_reference>82 Wn. App. 680</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>686-87</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>919 P.2d 128</cross_reference>
(1996).

De la Rosa moved at trial under ER 404(b) to exclude evidence of the February 5 and 20 contacts between Detective Kirk and de la Rosa. The trial court concluded that the evidence regarding the February 5 contact was admissible only for the purpose of identification and that the February 20 contact was merely a continuation of the February 19 charged transaction.

As identification apparently was an important issue at trial, the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of the February 5 contact for that purpose. The court properly limited the evidence solely to the contact between Kirk and de la Rosa on that date and precluded any mention of heroin. Following the court's limitation, Kirk testified merely that he observed and spoke with de la Rosa in English on February 5 for three to seven minutes. Thus, even assuming error, there is no reasonable probability that this brief and limited testimony materially affected the trial's outcome. See Smith, <cross_reference>106 Wn.2d at 780</cross_reference>.

The evidence supports the trial court's characterization of the February 20 contact as a continuation of the charged transaction `on or about February 19' rather than as evidence of `other crimes, wrongs, or acts.' ER 404(b). Alternatively, under an ER 404(b) analysis, the evidence does "complete the story of the crime on trial." State v. Tharp, <cross_reference>27 Wn. App. 198</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>204</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>616 P.2d 693</cross_reference> (1980) (quoting Edward W. Clearly, McCormick on Evidence § 190, at 488 (2d ed. 1972)), aff'd,<cross_reference>96 Wn.2d 591</cross_reference> (1981). Additionally, the evidence has some relevance to de la Rosa's knowledge of the nature of the controlled substance. See State v. Johnson, <cross_reference>119 Wn.2d 143</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>147</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>829 P.2d 1078</cross_reference> (1992) (knowledge of the nature of the substance is an essential element of unlawful delivery).

Even assuming error, de la Rosa fails to allege any specific prejudice. Given the substantial evidence supporting the verdict, including Detective Kirk's testimony, the videotapes of the transactions, and de la Rosa's own admission that he delivered heroin to Kirk, any error was harmless.

<center>                           II. Jury Instructions</center>
De la Rosa argues that the trial court's jury instructions `were unclear' and that his proposed instruction `correctly stated the law,' set forth his theory of the case, and was necessary to present his theory to the jury. Appellant's Br. at 27. Initially, he fails to comply with RAP 10.3(g), which requires `[a] separate assignment of error for each instruction which a party contends was improperly given or refused . . . with reference to each instruction or proposed instruction by number.' Moreover, his argument lacks merit.

Jury instructions satisfy the defendant's right to a fair trial if, taken as a whole, they accurately inform the jury of the relevant law, are not misleading, and allow the defendant to argue his theory of the case. State v. Tili, <cross_reference>139 Wn.2d 107</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>126</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>985 P.2d 365</cross_reference> (1999). A trial court has substantial discretion in the wording of jury instructions as long as they comply with the above guidelines; the court need not give a requested instruction if other instructions adequately cover the subject matter. State v. Ng, <cross_reference>110 Wn.2d 32</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>41</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>750 P.2d 632</cross_reference> (1988); State v. Portrey, <cross_reference>102 Wn. App. 898</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>902</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>10 P.3d 481</cross_reference> (2000); State v. Kennard,<cross_reference>101 Wn. App. 533</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>537</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>6 P.3d 38</cross_reference>, review denied, <cross_reference>142 Wn.2d 1011</cross_reference>
(2000).The trial court instructed the jury regarding Count I as follows:

To convict the defendant of the crime of Delivery of a Controlled Substance as charged in Count I, each of the following elements of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:

(1) That on or about the 19th day of February, 1998, the defendant delivered heroin, a controlled substance;

(2) That the defendant knew that the substance delivered was a controlled substance; and

(3) That the acts occurred in the State of Washington.

If you find from the evidence that each of these elements have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of guilty.

On the other hand, if, after weighing all the evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to any one of these elements, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of not guilty.

CP at 167. In lieu of this instruction, de la Rosa proposed the following instruction: `In order to convict the defendant on count #1, you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant delivered the heroin contained in exhibit #3 to Det. Kirk on 2/19/98.' CP at 159.

De la Rosa fails to explain why the court's instruction was misleading, why it erroneously stated the law, or why he needed his proposed instruction to argue his theory of the case. In addition, his proposed instruction omits an essential element of the offense, i.e., knowledge. See Johnson, <cross_reference>119 Wn.2d at 147</cross_reference>. Thus, the trial court properly rejected it.

<center>                      III. Pro Se Supplemental Issues</center><center>         A. Delayed Discovery  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</center>
De la Rosa suggests that the State was untimely in providing discovery and/or that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to, or move to suppress, a videotape. Apparently, there were two videotapes, neither of which are part of the record on appeal. Detective Kirk testified about the production and the contents of the recordings.

There is no support in the record for any claim that the State provided untimely discovery. The parties stipulated to the admissibility of the videotape on the day of trial but there is no indication that the State had just revealed this evidence to the defense.

As to a possible ineffective assistance of counsel claim, de la Rosa must establish that his trial counsel's performance was objectively unreasonable and that there was a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have differed absent those errors. State v. McFarland, <cross_reference>127 Wn.2d 322</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>334-35</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>899 P.2d 1251</cross_reference> (1995). See also State v. Hendrickson, <cross_reference>129 Wn.2d 61</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>78</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>917 P.2d 563</cross_reference> (1996) (claim fails if either prong is not met). We employ a strong presumption that counsel provided effective representation; legitimate trial tactics do not constitute deficient performance. McFarland, <cross_reference>127 Wn.2d at 335</cross_reference>; State v. Garrett, <cross_reference>124 Wn.2d 504</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>520</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>881 P.2d 185</cross_reference> (1994).

De la Rosa provides no support for his contention that a motion to suppress the videotapes would have been successful. See McFarland,<cross_reference>127 Wn.2d at 337</cross_reference> n. 4 (there must be affirmative showing that suppression motion probably would have been granted to establish actual prejudice). According to Kirk's testimony, the tapes contained a recording of the transactions charged in the information. This was relevant evidence of de la Rosa's identity and the State apparently was able to lay a foundation for the tape's admission. See State v. Newman, <cross_reference>4 Wn. App. 588</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>593</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>484 P.2d 473</cross_reference> (1971). Thus, de la Rosa's ineffective assistance claim lacks merit.

<center>                         B. CrR 3.3 — Striker Rule</center>
De la Rosa alleges a denial of his right to a speedy trial `when the state deliberately delayed filing criminal charges against him[.]' Pro Se Supp. Br. at 1. The State concedes that the arraignment delay was sufficiently long to trigger initial consideration of the rule in State v. Striker, <cross_reference>87 Wn.2d 870</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>557 P.2d 847</cross_reference> (1976). But it contends that de la Rosa waived his objection by failing to object when he was arraigned.

When `a long and unnecessary delay occurs in bringing a defendant who is amenable to process before the court,' the filing date of the information becomes the constructive arraignment date for purposes of triggering the speedy trial clock. State v. Greenwood, <cross_reference>120 Wn.2d 585</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>591</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>845 P.2d 971</cross_reference> (1993); see also Striker, <cross_reference>87 Wn.2d at 875</cross_reference>. A delay of 45 days or more between filing of the information and the defendant's first appearance is sufficiently long to invoke initial consideration of the so-called Striker rule. Greenwood, <cross_reference>120 Wn.2d at 599</cross_reference>; State v. Carpenter, <cross_reference>94 Wn.2d 690</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>694</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>619 P.2d 697</cross_reference> (1980).

A defendant who absents himself from the jurisdiction, even if the State knows his whereabouts, is not amenable to process during that absence. State v. Stewart, <cross_reference>130 Wn.2d 351</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>361</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>922 P.2d 1356</cross_reference> (1996); State v. Lee, <cross_reference>48 Wn. App. 322</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>323</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>325</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>738 P.2d 1081</cross_reference> (1987). In such situations, Striker does not apply and we calculate the speedy trial period from the defendant's actual arraignment date. Stewart,<cross_reference>130 Wn.2d at 362</cross_reference>; Lee, <cross_reference>48 Wn. App. at 323</cross_reference>.

Here, de la Rosa made his Striker motion to dismiss approximately five months after his arraignment. The trial court found that: (1) The State filed the information in Cowlitz County Superior Court on February 26, 1999, and the trial court issued an arrest warrant for de la Rosa on the same date; (2) according to police reports, the only known addresses for de la Rosa were in the Portland, Oregon area; (3) the State did not send a letter to de la Rosa or issue a summons for his appearance; (4) Portland, Oregon police contacted de la Rosa on April 16, 1999, and the INS had him in its custody on May 3, 1999; and (5) de la Rosa appeared in Cowlitz County Superior Court on May 5, 1999, on the arrest warrant in this case and he was arraigned on the information on May 13. The trial court concluded that de la Rosa was not amenable to process in Washington between the date the State filed the information and the arraignment date. Because the speedy trial clock is stayed during the time a defendant is not amenable to process, the trial court found no CrR 3.3 violation.

Given the trial court's factual findings, which de la Rosa does not challenge on appeal, Striker does not apply. See State v. Roman,<cross_reference>94 Wn. App. 211</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>216</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>972 P.2d 511</cross_reference> (1999) (defendant has burden of proving amenability). On day 57 of the speedy trial period, de la Rosa signed his first speedy trial waiver and he continued to sign waivers that covered the period until his trial date. Thus, there was no violation of his speedy trial rights.

The State also asserts that de la Rosa waived any objection to the timeliness of his arraignment by failing to properly object on that basis at his arraignment. See CrR 3.3(e).2 As the above analysis regarding de la Rosa's lack of amenability to process controls this issue, we need not reach the State's waiver argument. Because the Striker rule does not apply when the defendant is not amenable to process, the trial court did not err in denying de la Rosa's motion to dismiss. See Stewart,<cross_reference>130 Wn.2d at 362</cross_reference>.

Affirmed.

A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>, it is so ordered.

WE CONCUR: MORGAN, P.J., BRIDGEWATER, J.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The State charged the defendant as `Delarosa' and he signed the documents in the record as `de la Rosa.' But the judgment and sentence document refers to him as `Delarosa-Juarez.' We use the name `de la Rosa' as that is the name the parties use in their appellate briefs. 2 CrR 3.3(e) provides in relevant part:

A party who objects to the date of arraignment on the ground that it is not within the time limits prescribed by this rule must state the objection to the court at the time of the arraignment. . . . Failure of a party to object as required shall be a waiver of the objection, and the date of arraignment shall be conclusively established as the date upon which the defendant was actually arraigned.</footnote_body>
