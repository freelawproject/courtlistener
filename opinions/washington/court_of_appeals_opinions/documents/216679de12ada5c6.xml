<opinion_text><unpublished>  Michael Morrissey appeals his conviction of first degree child rape, arguing that the court erred in admitting evidence of other sexual incidents with the victim. He also contends that the court should have instructed the jury not to draw any inference from his invocation of the<cross_reference>Fifth</cross_reference> Amendment during cross examination. We find no error and, accordingly, affirm.

<center>                                  FACTS</center>
Michael Morrissey's 10-year-old stepdaughter, A.H., was taking a shower after swimming. Morrissey entered the bathroom and opened the shower stall. He soaped his finger and put it in A.H.'s vagina. The incident took place in Pierce County.

A.H.'s mother, Peggy Morrissey, saw Morrissey exiting the bathroom; he told her he had been showing A.H. how to wash herself. Morrissey also said he thought A.H. had a yeast infection. Later, he said that A.H. was crying from the pain of a vaginal infection.

A.H., in fact, sought medical attention for a vaginal problem. The doctor did not prescribe any medication, but told A.H. to change out of her wet bathing suit after swimming. For her part, A.H. denied that she was crying, in pain, or suffering from a vaginal infection. A.H. also denied talking to Morrissey about a vaginal infection.

A.H. testified about other sexual contacts. She said Morrissey had her sit on his lap when she was 10 or 11 years old, while he pulled up her tank top and started sucking her breasts. And one day when she was sick, Morrissey took her hand and tried to make her grab his penis.

A.H. also described several incidents that occurred after the family moved to Mason County. A.H. testified that she was stacking wood with Morrissey when he decided she was working too slowly and undressed her. Morrissey then tried to get their dog to lick A.H.'s vaginal area. On another occasion, Morrissey took off A.H.'s clothes and forced her to lie backwards on a saw horse. Another time, Morrissey pushed her down to a bed, asked her to call him `master,' and demanded she engage in sexual intercourse. On another day, Morrissey pushed A.H. against a couch, took off her pants, and attempted anal intercourse. Morrissey would also unhook A.H.'s bra strap and hook it on to her belt loops. Finally, A.H. testified that Morrissey tickled her, popped off her pants button, and stuck his hand down her pants. A.H. told her mother about the `button' incident.

A.H. reported the incidents to a Child Protective Services (CPS) worker, who called Mason County law enforcement. Morrissey met with CPS workers and admitted attaching A.H.'s bra strap to her belt loop. But he denied sexually abusing A.H.

Morrissey also talked with a Mason County Sheriff's detective. During this conversation, Morrissey confirmed some of what A.H. had told the CPS worker. But he said he had unbuttoned her pants only because she was having breathing problems. He also said that if he put his hand down her pants, it was an accident or a joke. He admitted pinching A.H.'s buttocks, but denied touching her vagina. He also admitted pinching A.H.'s inner thigh area and a possible `accidental touch.'

The detective asked Morrissey about the Pierce County shower incident. Morrissey said A.H. was crying because of a painful vaginal infection. Morrissey said he put his finger into A.H.'s vagina to help her clean herself.

During Morrissey's Pierce County trial,<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> a doctor testified that A.H. sought medical treatment for a possible urinary infection. Tests did not show a urinary infection.

Morrissey stipulated that he penetrated A.H.'s vagina with his finger. The State charged Morrissey in Pierce County with first degree rape of a child based upon the shower incident. During his CrR 3.5 hearing, the court held that his statements to the Mason County police officer were admissible because he was not in custody at the time. The court also granted the State's motion to allow evidence of the other incidents to show Morrissey's lustful disposition towards A.H. and to rebut accident or mistake. The court ruled that the evidence's probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect.

Morrissey testified about the shower incident. But before cross examination, his attorney advised the court that Morrissey would not answer any questions about the Mason County charges. Defense counsel also asked that the State not be allowed to question Morrissey about the Mason County incidents. The court ruled that the State could ask about the incidents because Morrissey had already admitted committing the acts.

<center>                                ANALYSIS</center><center>    I. Evidence of Other Sexual Acts Between Morrissey and the Victim</center>
`Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.' ER 404(b). But such evidence is admissible to show motive, intent, or absence of mistake or accident. See State v. Herzog,<cross_reference>73 Wn. App. 34</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>49</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>867 P.2d 648</cross_reference> (1994). In a sex crime, such evidence is admissible to show the defendant's lustful disposition towards the victim. State v. Ray, <cross_reference>116 Wn.2d 531</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>547</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>806 P.2d 1220</cross_reference> (1991). When considering lustful disposition, `{t}he important thing is whether it can be said that it evidences a sexual desire for the particular female.' State v. Ferguson, <cross_reference>100 Wn.2d 131</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>134</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>667 P.2d 68</cross_reference> (1983). Before admitting such evidence, the trial court must weigh its probative value against the possible prejudicial effect; if the prejudicial effect substantially outweighs the probative value, the court should reject the evidence. State v. Fitzgerald, <cross_reference>39 Wn. App. 652</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>661</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>694 P.2d 1117</cross_reference>
(1985); ER 404(b). We will overturn the trial court's decision only for an abuse of discretion. Fitzgerald, <cross_reference>39 Wn. App. at 661</cross_reference>.

Morrissey contends that the Mason County evidence `is inflammatory far beyond its probative value.' App. Br. at 12. Morrissey suggests that the prejudice was self-evident because he was forced to assert his<cross_reference>Fifth</cross_reference> Amendment right against self-incrimination.

At trial Morrissey admitted that he put his finger in A.H.'s vagina, but he claimed that he did so for hygienic purposes. Thus, the only remaining issue was whether Morrissey acted for hygienic or sexual purposes. And Morrissey's other sexual contacts with the victim were not only relevant but very likely the best evidence of what he intended towards A.H. Although the evidence described distasteful conduct, numerous cases have allowed similar testimony.

In Ray, <cross_reference>116 Wn.2d at 535</cross_reference>, the court allowed the victim to testify that the defendant, ten years before the charged incident, had rubbed her breasts and buttocks, touched her `up top,' pulled her onto his lap, and placed his hand under her shirt and touched her vagina. In State v. Carver, <cross_reference>37 Wn. App. 122</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>126</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>678 P.2d 842</cross_reference> (1984), the court allowed the defendant's stepdaughter to testify that the defendant had previously engaged in, among other things, anal intercourse with her. And in State v. Woolworth, <cross_reference>30 Wn. App. 901</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>906</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>639 P.2d 216</cross_reference> (1981), the court allowed evidence that the defendant engaged in prior sexual contact with his stepdaughter, including oral sex, masturbation, and `digital intercourse.' We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudice in this instance.

<center>        II. Limiting Instruction — <cross_reference>Fifth</cross_reference> Amendment Right Against Self-Incrimination</center>
Morrissey next maintains that the trial court should have instructed the jury that it could draw no inference from the fact that he invoked his<cross_reference>Fifth</cross_reference> Amendment right not to answer certain questions.

At trial, Morrissey testified about his military career, his medical condition, and his character. He denied touching A.H. for sexual purposes.

The State intended to cross examine Morrissey about the `button' incident in Mason County, which had already been admitted into evidence. A Mason County police officer testified that Morrissey admitted giving A.H. wedgies, popping her bra strap, and breaking off her pant buttons. The court allowed the questioning, but on the advice of his counsel, Morrissey invoked his <cross_reference>Fifth</cross_reference> Amendment right against self-incrimination. The State did not ask the court to order that Morrissey answer the questions. Although we question whether Morrissey had a right to refuse to answer the cross examination questions,<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> the State concedes that under these circumstances, he did. The State argues, however, that the error is harmless. We agree.

Constitutional error is harmless if we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not contribute to the verdict. State v. Farr-Lenzini, <cross_reference>93 Wn. App. 453</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>465</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>970 P.2d 313</cross_reference> (1999). Here, the court had already allowed A.H. to testify about the Mason County incidents. And a Mason County police officer had testified that Morrissey admitted the incidents but claimed an innocent motive. Thus, when Morrissey refused to answer, the jury was denied only his repeated explanation of the incidents with an innocent explanation.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>

Moreover, the State's evidence of Morrissey's guilt was persuasive. A.H. testified to numerous incidents. And Morrissey admitted many of the contacts, offering only that they were an accident, a joke, or done for medical purposes. The number and nature of the incidents make this extremely unlikely. Accordingly, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the failure to give a limiting instruction did not contribute to the jury verdict.

<center>           III. Prosecutorial Misconduct — Perjured Testimony</center>
Morrissey contends that the State allowed A.H. to present perjured testimony concerning a missing medical record of vaginal problems. He argues that because the records were, in fact, not missing, the prosecution knowingly offered perjured testimony. Finally, Morrissey argues that A.H. and her mother divulged additional facts after their interviews with detectives and CPS workers.

A person commits first degree perjury when, `in any official proceeding he makes a materially false statement which he knows to be false under an oath required or authorized by law.' RCW <cross_reference>9A.72.020</cross_reference> (2002). A person commits second degree perjury if, `with intent to mislead a public servant in the performance of his or her duty, he or she makes a materially false statement, which he or she knows to be false under an oath required or authorized by law.' RCW <cross_reference>9A.72.030</cross_reference> (2002).

It is fundamentally unfair for the State to knowingly use perjured testimony to convict a defendant; such a verdict must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury. In re Personal Restraint of Benn, <cross_reference>134 Wn.2d 868</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>936-37</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>952 P.2d 116</cross_reference> (1998) (citing United States v. Agurs, <cross_reference>427 U.S. 97</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>103</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>96 S.Ct. 2392</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>49 L.Ed.2d 342</cross_reference> (1976)). A court, however, need not decide whether the State knowingly offered perjured testimony if there is no reasonable likelihood that the testimony could have affected the jury's judgment. In re Benn, <cross_reference>134 Wn.2d at 937</cross_reference>.

The State told the court that A.H. and her mother had told the prosecutor and defense counsel that they were unable to locate A.H.'s medical record of a hospital visit for a vaginal infection. About two weeks later, A.H.'s mother said she found the missing record in her file cabinet. The court admitted the missing record into evidence without objection.

Morrissey does not expressly state what testimony constituted the alleged perjury. He points to comments regarding collateral matters such as A.H. taking drugs to school and getting suspended. The record does not demonstrate that A.H. or her mother ever discussed the matter under oath. Moreover, if there was any confusion about whether A.H. was experiencing vaginal problems, the medical record was admitted into evidence. Thus, the jury was aware of any misstatements A.H. and her mother may have made. And although Morrissey claims that A.H. did not testify truthfully about when she first saw the medical record in question, A.H. testified that she could not remember when she saw the record following her medical examination. Morrissey provides no evidence that A.H. perjured herself with this testimony.

The record does demonstrate that A.H. and her mother initially told Mason County police officers and CPS workers that A.H. did not seek medical attention for a vaginal infection. These statements were untrue. A.H. and her mother, in fact, had the missing medical record showing that A.H. sought medical attention for a vaginal infection. The statements by A.H. and her mother do raise witness credibility issues, which Morrissey was free to exploit. The statements, however, were not made under oath and were not perjury.

<center>                  IV. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</center>
Both the <cross_reference>Sixth</cross_reference> Amendment to the United States Constitution and article <cross_reference>I</cross_reference>, section <cross_reference>22</cross_reference> of the Washington Constitution guarantee the right to effective assistance of counsel. Strickland v. Washington, <cross_reference>466 U.S. 668</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>684-86</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>104 S.Ct. 2052</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>80 L.Ed.2d 674</cross_reference> (1984); State v. Hendrickson,<cross_reference>129 Wn.2d 61</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>77</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>917 P.2d 563</cross_reference> (1996). Counsel is ineffective when his or her performance falls below an objective standard of reasonableness, and the defendant suffers prejudice. Strickland, <cross_reference>466 U.S. at 687</cross_reference>; In re Brett, <cross_reference>142 Wn.2d 868</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>873</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>16 P.3d 601</cross_reference> (2001).

In determining whether counsel was ineffective, we ask whether, considering all the circumstances, counsel acted reasonably in representing the defendant. Strickland, <cross_reference>466 U.S. at 689-90</cross_reference>. Legitimate, but unsuccessful, trial strategy or tactics do not demonstrate that counsel was ineffective. State v. Lord, <cross_reference>117 Wn.2d 829</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>883</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>822 P.2d 177</cross_reference>
(1991). Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of law and fact and, thus, subject to de novo review. In re Brett,<cross_reference>142 Wn.2d at 873</cross_reference>.

Prejudice is established when there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel's errors, the trial outcome would have been different. In re Brett, <cross_reference>142 Wn.2d at 873</cross_reference>. The defendant has the heavy burden of showing that counsel's performance was deficient in light of all surrounding circumstances. State v. Hayes, <cross_reference>81 Wn. App. 425</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>442</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>914 P.2d 788</cross_reference> (1996).

<center>   A. Failure to Interview, Contact, and Investigate Certain Witnesses Prior to Trial</center>
Morrissey argues that his counsel should have interviewed his son and any of three physicians. Morrissey claims that his son would have testified that Morrissey was too ill or too medicated to have taken A.H. to the hospital for medical treatment, supporting his reason for helping A.H. clean herself rather than seeking medical assistance. Morrissey further claims that Drs. Johnson, Bertram, and Duralde would have provided similar testimony.

But Morrissey provides no evidence that counsel failed to interview the witnesses. Nor does he provide declarations as to what each witness would have said. Thus, even if counsel failed to interview the witnesses, Morrissey does not demonstrate that he was prejudiced. His claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to interview the witnesses, therefore, fails. See In re Brett, <cross_reference>142 Wn.2d at 873</cross_reference>.

<center>  B. Failure to Cross Examine Victim About Being Molested Years Earlier in Another State</center>
Morrissey's counsel learned just before trial that A.H. had been molested years earlier in Oklahoma. He contends that counsel should have brought this out in cross examination.

But this may well have been a tactical decision. See Hayes,<cross_reference>81 Wn. App. at 442</cross_reference>
(trial counsel's decision in a child sex case not to present testimony about prior sexual abuse by the victim's mother was presumably a tactical decision). Furthermore, evidence of the earlier molestation is probably not relevant. Evidence that A.H. had been molested years earlier could explain her sophistication in describing Morrissey's conduct. But Morrissey admitted putting his finger in A.H.'s vagina, and he admitted much of the sexual conduct in Mason County. Thus, the issue was not whether these acts occurred, but what Morrissey intended when he inappropriately touched A.H. in the shower.

<center>      C. Failure to Request an Instruction About Perjured Testimony</center>
Morrissey argues that counsel should have asked the court to instruct the jury to consider A.H.'s perjury when weighing her testimony. This argument fails because, as we have discussed, there was no evidence that A.H. committed perjury.

Affirmed.

A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>, it is so ordered.

SEINFELD, P.J., and BRIDGEWATER, J., concur.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Morrissey was initially tried and convicted of second degree child molestation in Mason County. This court reversed the trial court and remanded the case for new trial. See State v. Morrissey, noted at<cross_reference>104 Wn.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> When the defendant takes the stand on his own behalf, he is subject to cross examination the same as any other witness. State v.
