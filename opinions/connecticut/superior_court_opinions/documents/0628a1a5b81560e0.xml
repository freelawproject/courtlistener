</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The defendant, Robert Wasilewski, in a Motion dated March 11, 2005, entitled "Motion for Determination" requests a determination by the court as to the meaning of a clause, to wit, Section 8.2, contained in the parties' separation agreement dated September 28, 2000, and incorporated by reference into the judgment of dissolution the same date.

The plaintiff joined in the request, as the parties were unable to reach an agreement as to the clause in question, and thereafter filed a document entitled "Plaintiff's Position Regarding Motion for Determination."

The court heard oral argument on the matter on April 11, 2005, and ordered each party to submit briefs and claims for relief.

The issue presented requires the court to interpret and apply the separation agreement incorporated into the judgment, a task governed by the principles of contract law. <italic>Greenburg v.</italic><italic>Greenburg,</italic> <cross_reference>26 Conn.App. 591</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>595</cross_reference> (1992). A principle of contract law relevant to the issue before the court was enunciated as follows:

<block_quote>  Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms . . . Although ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties'+ intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law. <italic>ARB</italic> <italic>Construction, LLC v. Pitney Construction Corp.,</italic> <cross_reference>75 Conn.App. 151</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>154</cross_reference> (2003).</block_quote>

CT Page 9051

Further, "the court will not torture words to impart ambiguity where ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity . . . [the] mere fact that the parties advance different interpretations of the language in question does not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous." <italic>United Illuminating Co. v.</italic><italic>WisVest-Connecticut, LLC,</italic> <cross_reference>259 Conn. 665</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>670</cross_reference> (2002). "The contract must be construed to give effect to the intent of the contracting parties . . . intent must be determined from the language of the instrument and not from any intention either of the parties may have secretly entertained. <italic>Greenburg, supra</italic> at 596.

Section 8.2 of the parties' separation agreement states as follows:

<block_quote>  The Wife shall give the Husband have [sic.] an equitable mortgage for one half of the net equity [as defined as the value of the premises at the time that payment is due after deducting the balance remaining on the first mortgage after all scheduled payments by Wife, costs of closing, and a credit for the principal payments made by the Wife]. The mortgage shall be due when the youngest child reaches the age of 18, the Wife remarries or cohabitates with an unmarried male, pursuant to statute, or the premises are sold.</block_quote>

On March 3, 2005, the plaintiff refinanced the mortgage and removed the defendant's name from all liability. The dispute between the parties concerns the amount which represents one-half of the net proceeds to be paid to the defendant. The figures from the closing are not in dispute, and are set forth as follows:

Value of the premises: $260,000.00

Unpaid Mortgage Balance: $35,061.00

Costs of closing: $2,103.00

Principal payments: $16,917.00

The parties disagree, however, on the manner in which said figures are utilized in order to arrive at the net equity described in their agreement. A transcript of the proceedings at CT Page 9052 the time of the parties' dissolution, attached as Appendix A, does not assist in the resolution of this issue.

The language in question is contained in parenthesis, meaning that each term within the parenthesis is intended to be considered in relation to the others. This "definitional section" contains terms joined together by commas as well as the word "and," meaning that such terms modified one another and therefore were to be considered in that relation to one another. Under the maxim of "noscitur a sociis," the meanings of particular words may be indicated or controlled by associated words. <italic>Smedley Co.</italic><italic>v. Employees Mutual Liability Inc. Co. v. Wis.,</italic> <cross_reference>143 Conn. 510</cross_reference>
(1958); <italic>Chicago Title Insurance Co. v. The Kent School,</italic> CV 3:02 CV 1095 (U.S. District Court, D. of Connecticut, March 17, 2005);<italic>Williston on Contracts,</italic> 4th Ed. (§ 32:6). "Intent is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract." <italic>Greenburg, supra</italic> at 596.

In applying the principles of law set forth previously, the court finds that pursuant to the language in Section 8.2, the defendant was to receive one-half of the net equity. There is nothing ambiguous in the parties separation agreement. Net equity was defined by the parties' in Section 8.2 of said agreement. The net equity is therefore arrived at by ascertaining the value of the premises, from which is deducted the first mortgage balance, the costs of closing, and the credit to the wife for her principal reduction. According to <italic>Black's Law Dictionary,</italic> (8th Ed. 2004), credit is defined as a "deduction from an amount due." As noted above, the phrase ". . . and a credit for the principal payments made by the wife" appears within the parenthesis, and is thus to be considered in relation to the words associated with it. See <italic>Williston, Smedley Co.</italic> and <italic>Chicago Title Insurance</italic><italic>Co., supra.</italic>

Therefore, using the definition of net equity as described above, the court determines the proceeds of the sale shall be divided pursuant to the following calculation:

Value of Premises: $260,000.00

<italic>Deductions</italic>

1 Mortgage balance $35,061.00 CT Page 9053

2 Closing costs $2,103.00

3 Principal payments $16,917.00

Net Equity $205,919.00

$205,919.00 divided by 2 = $102,959.50

The plaintiff, at oral argument and in her brief, invites the court to apply extrinsic evidence, or parol evidence, in order to arrive at a determination of the issue. Plaintiff claims that the amount which represents one-half of the net proceeds to be paid to defendant is arrived at by subtracting from defendant's share her principal payment, which she characterizes as "below the line" from where the mortgage balance and costs of closing are subtracted from the fair market value. She further argues that her waiver of alimony provides additional support for her claim.

However, the court must ". . . adhere to the general principle that the unambiguous terms of a written contract containing a merger clause may not be varied or contradicted by extrinsic evidence." <italic>Alstom Power Inc., v. Balcke-Durr Inc.,</italic><cross_reference>269 Conn. 599</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>610</cross_reference> (2004). Having found the contract to be unambiguous, "[t]o permit oral testimony, or prior to contemporaneous conversations, or circumstances, or usages, in order to learn what was intended, or to contradict what is written, would be dangerous and unjust in the extreme . . ." <italic>Id.</italic> At 609.

The parties' agreement, Section 20, does contain a merger clause as follows:

<block_quote>  This agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no representations, warranties, promises, terms, conditions, provisions, or undertakings of any sort by either party to the other' except those expressly set forth herein.</block_quote>

Nothing in the agreement itself juxtaposed plaintiff's argument regarding the calculation of net equity with alimony. Plaintiff's juxtaposition of her waiver of alimony and her interpretation of net equity is not based on the agreement or attached transcript. The waiver of alimony by <italic>both</italic> parties, in Section 5, is silent as to any other considerations relevant to said waiver. Further, CT Page 9054 plaintiff's use of the phrase "below the line" appears nowhere in the agreement. There is no modifying language outside of the parenthesis. With regard to plaintiff's claims, the court finds that "the parties could have written such an agreement, but they did not do so." <italic>Tallmadge Brothers, Inc., v. Iroquois Gas</italic><italic>Transmission System, L.P.,</italic> <cross_reference>252 Conn. 479</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>496</cross_reference> (2000). Plaintiff's interpretation of the contract is unwarranted by the language of Section 8.2, and would result in plaintiff receiving, in effect, a double benefit from the principle payments.

"[A]ny ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party's subjective perception of its terms." <italic>Alstom Power, Inc., supra</italic> at 611.

For the foregoing reasons, the court determines that the defendant's share of the refinancing proceeds is $102,959.50, and the plaintiff is ordered to pay over said sum within ten days of the entry of this order.

MS. KOTOWSKI: Your Honor, do you want me —

THE COURT: No. Do I need an affidavit here from Mr. Wasilewski?

MR. ANGELO: I thought mine had been presented, your Honor. CT Page 9057

THE COURT: And no other children have been born to you since the date of your marriage other than Robert and David stated in Paragraph 3a?

MS. WASILEWSKI: No.

MS. KOTOWSKI: Thank you, your Honor.

THE COURT: Written it on the Complaint. And the guideline support is two hundred dollars a week?

MS. KOTOWSKI: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: Just going to write that in. Now the health insurance? I understand what they are trying to do, but perhaps you want to retain the option that she is going to carry the insurance for the kids until he's employed and has insurance available and that they are going to split the excess unreimbursed fifty/fifty; is that correct?

MS. KOTOWSKI: That's correct, your Honor.

THE COURT: If, for example, when he becomes employed and if the insurance is available to him and it is not as bad as the insurance that she has you might want the option of him agreeing to continue to reimburse her for that cost if your insurance should be better.

MS. WASILEWSKI: Okay.

MR. ANGELO: Is that agreeable to you?

MR. WASILEWSKI: Yes, agreeable to me.

THE COURT: Save you money probably in the long run because you're uninsured.

MR. ANGELO: To simplify it, your Honor, she would carry while he didn't have it, and carry when she didn't have it, agreeable between the parties if her insurance is the better. Putting it on the record. Wanted to do that. That's perfectly all right.

THE COURT: Okay. It's whatever works out to their mutual benefit. CT Page 9058

MS. KOTOWSKI: Agreeable.

THE COURT: Yes. Agreeable?

MR. ANGELO: No problem, your Honor.

THE COURT: No alimony order entered. He can remain seated. Neither one of you can ever come back to the Court in the future and seek alimony, do you understand?

MR. WASILEWSKI: Yes, I do

MS. WASILEWSKI: Yes.

THE COURT: And the visitation schedule is going to be — custody of visitation is in accordance with the Family Relations Officer's report.

MR. ANGELO: That is correct, your Honor.
