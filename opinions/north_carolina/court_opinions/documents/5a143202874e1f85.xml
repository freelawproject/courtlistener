<opinion_text>  Greun Madainn, Inc. (Greun Madainn), Paul R. Fransella, and Noel V. Fransella (collectively, defendants)<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> appeal an order of summary judgment entered in favor of Phillips and Jordan Investment Corporation, Carolyn Lloyd Coward, Pricella Lloyd Mowery, and Benita Ann Lloyd (plaintiffs). For the reasons stated below, the order of the superior court is affirmed in part and reversed in part.

This case arises from a 21 February 2006 complaint by which plaintiffs asked the Graham County Superior Court to quiet title in an easement and right of way for roadway pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>41-10</cross_reference>. At the time plaintiffs filed their claim, plaintiffs owned a seventy-seven acre property in Graham County, and the parcel's eastern border abutted three parcels owned by defendants and Barbara Jones Garland.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The complaint alleged that plaintiffs owned "an appurtenant easement and right of way for roadway, 40 feet in width" that "crosses and encumbers" the parcels owned by defendants. The complaint further alleged that defendants initiated an agreement dated 31 March 1976 "definitely to fix and establish the location and width of said road right of way. . . ." The 1976 agreement describes the centerline of the right of way by courses and distances. A stream runs along the northern boundary of plaintiffs' property and also marks the eastern boundary of Garland's property and the western boundary of Greun Madainn's property. The complaint asserted that the "easement and right of way runs along and to the east of the stream and is situated upon" Greun Madainn and the Fransella's property.

Plaintiffs alleged that Greun Madainn and the Fransellas, "with the assistance or acquiescence of Defendant Barbara Jones Garland's predecessors in title, caused a dam to be constructed across the stream, and the impoundment of water . . . totally flooded and blocked Plaintiffs' easement and right of way." Plaintiffs could not access their property because the easement and right of way were underwater. The complaint alleged, "Defendants claim to have the right to flood, block and obstruct Plaintiffs' easement and right of way for roadway, which claim is adverse to Plaintiffs," and therefore plaintiffs have the right to have their title quieted.

In response, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, motion for judgment on the pleadings, and answer on 9 May 2006. In that same document, Greun Madainn asserted a counterclaim, which states, in relevant part:

<center>                           FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION</center><block_quote>  1. Defendant openly, continuously, notoriously and adversely possessed the servient tenement in a manner completely inconsistent with the use of the property as a right of way for a period greater than 21 years, in that among other things Defendant's agents have kept a chain across the access road to the property.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2. Defendants are entitled to judgment that Plaintiffs['] claims have been extinguished by the adverse possession of the estate claimed by Plaintiffs.</block_quote>

<center>                           SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION</center><block_quote>  1. Plaintiffs contend and Defendants deny that the pond trespasses upon Defendants['] right of way easement.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2. Should the Court determine that the pond does in fact encroach upon Plaintiffs' real property interest, then and in that event only the Court should determine that the encroachment is permanent in nature and determine the damages, if any, to Plaintiffs by Defendant Gruen Madainn, Inc. caused by the encroachment.</block_quote>

On 9 May 2007, plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment "pursuant to Rule 56 of the Rules of Civil Procedure . . . on the ground that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact . . . and [they are] entitled to judgment as a matter of law." In support of their motion, plaintiffs submitted an affidavit by G.L. Sprinkle, a surveyor, and Berniece A. Lloyd, a former owner of plaintiffs' parcel. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on 10 May 2007, and submitted an affidavit by Paul R. Fransella in support of their motion.

The superior court reviewed both motions and found that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The order decreed, in relevant part, that "Plaintiffs' right, title and interest in and to the easement and right-of-way for roadway . . . is hereby quieted pursuant to N.C.G.S. §<cross_reference>41-10</cross_reference>." The order then enjoined defendants from "flooding, blocking or otherwise obstructing Plaintiffs' easement and right-of-way" and gave plaintiffs "the right to remove or cause to be removed the dam and impoundment of water flooding, blocking and obstructing" their easement.

Defendants appealed the superior court's order. They argue, in essence, that summary judgment was inappropriate because plaintiffs failed to establish that there was no genuine issue of material fact with regard to the extinguishment of the easement by adverse possession.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>
We agree that the trial court erroneously awarded summary judgment on all issues in plaintiffs' favor.

Summary judgment is appropriate only "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>1A-1</cross_reference>, Rule 56(c) (2007).

<block_quote>  The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. If the movant successfully makes such a showing, the burden then shifts to the nonmovant to come forward with specific facts establishing the presence of a genuine factual dispute for trial. When considering a motion for summary judgment, the trial judge must view the presented evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. All inferences of fact must be drawn against the movant and in favor of the nonmovant. Moreover, the duty of the trial court in considering a motion for summary judgment is strictly confined to determining whether genuine issues of material fact exist and does not extend to resolving such issues. In short, the court's function at this juncture is to find factual issues, not to decide them.</block_quote>

(2002) (citations and quotations omitted). "On appeal from summary judgment, the applicable standard of review is whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." <italic>Smith v. Harris</italic>, <cross_reference>181 N.C. App. 585</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>587</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>640 S.E.2d 436</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>438</cross_reference> (2007) (citations and quotations omitted).

Defendants argue only that the superior court erred by granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment; they do not argue that the superior court erred by denying their own motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we ask whether plaintiffs demonstrated the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. With respect to Gruin Madainn's counterclaim that it had adversely possessed the servient tenement and thereby extinguished the easement, we hold that they did not.

Rule 56(a) allows a "party seeking to recover upon a claim" to move for summary judgment in his favor on that claim, and Rule 56(b) allows a "party against whom a . . . counterclaim . . . is asserted" to move for summary judgment in his favor on that counterclaim. N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>1A-1</cross_reference>, Rule 56(a), (b) (2007). Here, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment pursuant to "Rule 56" and did not specify whether their motion was limited to their own claim or included Greun Madainn's counterclaims. We asssume, because the superior court considered summary judgment motions from both parties, and defendants' motion addressed the counterclaim, and plaintiffs do not assert otherwise, that plaintiffs intended to dispose of both their claim and Greun Madainn's counterclaims by summary judgment. Accordingly, plaintiffs had the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether: (1) plaintiffs owned an appurtenant easement across defendants' property, which defendants obstructed; and (2) defendants extinguished plaintiffs' easement by defendants' adverse possession.

The affidavits that plaintiffs offered in support of their motion show that plaintiffs owned an appurtenant easement across defendants' property, and that the location of the easement was confirmed by the 31 March 1976 agreement. However, the affidavits do not address Greun Madainn's counterclaim that the easement was extinguished by adverse possession. "An easement may be extinguished by adverse use by the owner of the servient property for the prescriptive period." <italic>Skvarla v. Park</italic>,<cross_reference>62 N.C. App. 482</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>488</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>303 S.E.2d 354</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>358</cross_reference> (1983) (citations omitted). To extinguish an easement in this way, "possession is actual, open, notorious, exclusive, continuous, hostile, for the statutory period, and with intent to claim title to the land occupied." <italic>Id.</italic>
(citations omitted). The statutory period is twenty years. N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>1-40</cross_reference> (2007).

Greun Madainn asserted in its counterclaim that it was in possession of "the servient tenement in a manner completely inconsistent with the use of the property as a right of way for a period greater than 21 years, in that among other things Defendant's agents have kept a chain across the access road to the property." The parties stipulated that "[p]hysical construction of the dam . . . had not begun prior to March 13, 1986." Thus, the dam was not in place for longer than twenty years. However, plaintiffs did not address the alleged "chain across the access road to the property" in the affidavits submitted in support of their motion for summary judgment. The affidavit submitted by defendants in support of their motion for summary judgment reiterates that a "barrier" has barred plaintiffs' access to the right of way for longer than twenty years. Whether this "barrier" was in place for longer than twenty years is a material fact that is still at issue in this case. The question of its existence should be resolved by a fact finder, and summary judgment on the issue of extinguishment was not appropriate in this case. "[I]f there is any question as to the credibility of an affiant in a summary judgment motion or if there is a question which can be resolved only by the weight of the evidence, summary judgment should be denied." <italic>Bicycle Transit</italic><italic>Authority, Inc. v. Bell</italic>, <cross_reference>314 N.C. 219</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>224</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>333 S.E.2d 299</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>303</cross_reference> (1985) (citations and quotations omitted). However, because only Greun Madainn asserted this counterclaim, we affirm the order of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs as to defendants Paul R. Fransella and Noel V. Fransella. In addition, we affirm the order of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs as to defendant Greun Madainn on the issue of whether plaintiffs had a "right, title and interest in and to the easement and right-of-way for roadway" as described in the summary judgment order. Plaintiffs met their burden of proof that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether they had acquired the easement and where the easement was located. Defendants did not rebut plaintiffs' claims as to these facts.

Accordingly, we affirm the order of summary judgment as to the existence and location of the easement, but reverse the order with respect to Gruin Madainn's counterclaims. The matter is remanded for trial between plaintiffs and Gruin Madainn on the issue of extinguishment by adverse possession and, if necessary, damages caused by defendants' encroachment upon plaintiffs' interest in real property.

Affirmed in part; reversed in part and remanded to the trial court for disposition in accordance with the provisions set out herein.

Judges MCCULLOUGH and ARROWOOD concur.

Report per Rule 30(e).

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> A fourth defendant, Barbara Jones Garland, did not file a notice of appeal.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> It appears that Paul and Noel Fransella transferred their property to Michael Fransella on 12 January 2007, and Greun Madainn transferred its property to Michael Fransella on 13 April 2007.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> We note that defendants' sole assignment of error is wholly inadequate. It reads, "The Court committed reversible error by granting summary judgment against Plaintiff and in favor of Defendants in that the evidence forecast by Plaintiff against Defendants established that Plaintiff had a viable cause of action under North Carolina law. (R., at ___)." Although the lack of "clear and specific record or transcript references" obviously violates Rule 10(c)(1) of our Rules of Appellate Procedure, the larger problem is that the assignment of error is written in favor of the wrong party and is factually inaccurate. The superior court granted summary judgment against defendants and in favor of plaintiffs and defendants argue in their brief that defendants had a viable cause of action. Plaintiffs did not mention the violation in their brief and the quality of their brief indicates that they were not "left without notice of the basis upon which an appellate court might rule." Viar v. N.C. Dep't of Trans., <cross_reference>359 N.C. 400</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>402</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>610 S.E.2d 360</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>361</cross_reference>
(2005) (citation omitted). Although an "appeal is `subject to' dismissal for rules violations," we are not required to dismiss an appeal "for any violation." State v.

(2007). See N.C.R. App. P. 2 (2007) (allowing this Court to suspend the Rules of Appellate Procedure). Despite making an exception in this case, we strongly discourage rules violations and admonish defense counsel for their carelessness.</footnote_body>
