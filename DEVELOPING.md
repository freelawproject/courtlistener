# Developing in CourtListener

CourtListener is built upon a few key pieces of technology that need to come together. Whether you're contributing platform code, web design, etc. it helps to know the easiest ways to run and test the project.

Historically, we have used [wiki instructions to get set up][wiki], but these days most things can be accomplished using docker.

But before we can get into that, we must address...


## Legal Matters

Not surprisingly, we have a lot of legal, and particularly IP, lawyers around here. As a result, we endeavor to be a model for other open source projects in how we handle IP contributions and concerns.

We do this in a couple of ways. First, we use a copy-left license for CourtListener, the GNU GPL Affero license. Read the details in the license itself, but the high level is that it's a copy-left license for server code that isn't normally distributed to end users (like an app would be, say).

The other thing we do is require a contributor license agreement from any non-employees or non-contractors that contribute code to the project. You can find a form for this purpose in the root of our project. If you have any questions about it, please don't hesitate to ask.

On with the show.


# Discussing things

We host [a Discourse forum](https://flp.discourse.group/c/developer-discussions/8) where you can ask questions and search past ones.


## Architecture

The major components of CourtListener are:

 - Postgresql - For database storage. We used to use MySQL long ago, but it caused endless weird and surprising problems. Postgresql is great.

 - Redis - For in-memory fast storage, caching, task queueing, some stats logging, etc. Everybody loves Redis for a reason. It's great. If you have something small you want to store quickly and kind of durably, it's fantastic.

 - Celery - For running asynchronous tasks. We've been using this a long time. It causes a lot of annoyance and sometimes will have unsolvable bugs, but as of 2019 it's better than any of the competition that we've tried.

 - Tesseract - For OCR. It's getting good lately, which is nice since we convert hundreds of thousands of pages.

 - Solr - For making things searchable. It's *decent*. Our version is currently very old, but it hangs in there. We've also tried Sphinx a while back. We chose Sphinx early on literally because it had a smaller binary than Solr, and so seemed less intimidating (it was early times, and that logic might have been sound).

 - React - For dynamic front-end features. We're slowly moving the trickiest parts of the front end over to React.

 - Python/Django/et al - And their associated bits and pieces.


### Pulling Everything Together

We use a docker compose file to make development easier. Don't use it for production! It's not secure enough, and it uses bad practices for data storage. But if you're a dev, it should work nicely.

To set up a development server, do the following:

1. Clone the [courtlistener](https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener) and [courtlistener-solr-server](https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener-solr-server) repositories so that they are side-by-side in the same folder.

1. Install the React dependencies and get hot-reloading going. Install node, and then:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

1. Next, you'll need to update the group permissions for the Solr server. `cd` into the courtlistener-solr-server directory, and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R :1024 data
    sudo chown -R :1024 solr
    sudo find data -type d -exec chmod g+s {} \;
    sudo find solr -type d -exec chmod g+s {} \;
    sudo find data -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
    sudo find solr -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
    sudo find data -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
    sudo find solr -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
    ```

1. Create a personal settings file. To do that, `cd` into courtlistener/cl/settings and run the following:

    `cp 05-private.example 05-private.py`

    That will get you pretty far, but CourtListener does rely on a number of cloud services. To make all features work, you'll need to get tokens for these services. The main one you'll run into almost immediately is AWS S3 (tests won't pass without it). To make that work, you'll need to create an access token for a user with S3 access. This isn't too terribly hard, but for partners we can do it for you. Just ask.

    See [below](#how-settings-work-in-courtlistener) for more information about settings files.

1. Next, create the bridge network that the docker relies on:

    `docker network create -d bridge --attachable cl_net_overlay`

    This is important so that each service in the compose file can have a hostname.

1. Initialize the docker swarm:

    `docker swarm init`

1. `cd` into courtlistener/docker/courtlistener, then launch the server by running:

    `docker-compose up`

1. Finally, finish setting up the Django database. While the server is running:

    - Migrate the models by running:

        `docker exec -it cl-django python /opt/courtlistener/manage.py migrate`

    - Finally, create a new super user login by running this command, and entering the required information:

        `docker exec -it cl-django python /opt/courtlistener/manage.py createsuperuser`

So that should be it! You should now be able to access the following URLs:

 - <http://127.0.0.1:8000> - Your dev homepage
 - <http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin> - The Django admin page (try the super user)
 - <http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr> - Solr admin page
 - 127.0.0.1:5900 - A VNC server to the selenium machine (it doesn't serve http though)

A good next step is to [run the test suite](#testing) to verify that your development server is configured correctly.

## Logs

You can see most of the logs via docker when you start it. CourtListener also keeps a log in the `cl-django` image that you can tail with:

    docker exec -it cl-django tail -f /var/log/courtlistener/django.log

But usually you won't need to look at these logs.


## How Settings Work in CourtListener

The files in the `cl/settings` directory contain all of the settings for CourtListener. They are read in alphabetical order, with each subsequent file potentially overriding the previous one.

Thus, `10-public.py` contains default settings for CourtListener and Celery. To override it, simply create a file in `cl/settings` called `11-private.py`. Since `11` comes after `10` *alphabetically*, it'll override anything in `10-*`.

Files ending in `-public.py` are meant to be distributed in the code base. Those ending in `-private.py` are meant to stay on your machine. In theory, our `.gitignore` file will ignore them.

You can find an example file to use for `05-private.py` in `cl/settings`. It should have the defaults you need, but it's worth skimming through. Please don't rename this file; copy it instead. If you rename it, sooner or later you'll accidentally commit the missing file into a PR.

Files that are read later (with higher numbered file names) have access to the
context of files that are read earlier. For example, if `01-some-name.py`
contains:

    SOME_VAR = {'some-key': 'some-value'}

You could create a file called `02-my-overrides.py` that contained:

    SOME_VAR['some-key'] = 'some-other-value'

That is, you can assume that `SOME_VAR` exists because it was declared in an
earlier settings file. Your IDE will likely complain that `SOME_VAR` doesn't
exist in `02-my-overrides.py`, but ignore your IDE. If you want to read the
code behind all this, look in `settings.py` (in the root directory). It's
short.


## Guidelines for Contributions

For the most part, we use [Github flow][flow] to get our work done. Our
[BDFL][bdfl] and primary developer is [@mlissner][me]. For better and/or for worse,
he doesn't care too much about git, provided things get done smoothly and his
life is fairly easy. What that means generally, is:

1. Commits should represent a unit of work. In other words, if you're working
on a big feature, each commit should be a discrete step along the path of
getting that feature ready to land. Bad or experimental work shouldn't be in a
commit that you submit as part of a PR, if you can avoid it. Often you can clean up your commits with an interactive rebase followed by a force push to your branch.

1. Your commit messages should use [the format defined by the Angular.js
project][format]. This is pretty easy if you use [this plugin][format-plugin]
for Intellij/PyCharm/et al.

1. We use the [black][black] code formatter to make sure all our Python code
has the same formatting. This is an automated tool that you *must* run on any
code you run before you push it to Github. When you run it, it will reformat
your code. We recommend [integrating it into your editor][black-ed].

    Beyond what black will do for you by default, if you somehow find a way to
    do whitespace or other formatting changes, do so in their own commit and
    ideally in its own PR. When whitespace is combined with other code changes,
    the PR's become impossible to read and risky to merge. This is a big reason
    we use black.

1. We are beginning to use mypy to add type hints to our Python code. New code must include hints and updates to old code should add hints to the old code. The idea is for our hunts to gradually get better and more complete. Our Github Action for mypy is in lint.yml, and should be updated to run against any areas that have hints. This just takes a second once mypy is working properly on a file or module.

1. We use iSort to sort our imports. If your imports aren't sorted properly,
iSort will tell you so when you push your code to Github. Again, we recommend
getting iSort integrated into your editor or workflow.

1. *KEEP YOUR PR's SMALL*. A good PR should land a specific thing of some sort.
It doesn't have to be done — it doesn't even have to work! — but it should be
clean, and it should be your best effort at clean *progress*. PRs are both a way
of getting your work into the system and a way to *communicate* your work. The
latter is more important. 10 small, clean PRs are about 10× better than a
monolithic one that is fully functional.

    Say you are developing a system that relies on regexes to do something. Why
    not submit the regexes (and their tests!) in one PR and the thing that uses
    those regexes in another? That'd be much easier to review than trying to
    see the whole thing at once.

1. We have an editorconfig, an eslint configuration, and a black configuration.
Please use them.

1. We do not yet have a Code of Conduct, but we do have [our employee
manual][hr], and we expect all our employees and volunteers to abide by it.

These guidelines are a little sloppy compared with many projects. Those
projects have greater quality needs, are popular enough to demand a high
bar, and can envision coding techniques as a part of their overall goal. We
don't have to lead the industry with our approach, we just need to get good
work done. That's the goal here.

### Special notes for special types of code

1. If your PR includes a migration of the DB, we need SQL files for any tables
that we replicate to customers. These can be easily made with the `sqlmigrate`
command. See MIGRATIONS.md as well for details on smart migration files and why
this is needed.

2. If you alter any react code, include minified builds and map files of the new JS in your PR so that they can be deployed. While developing, you will have non-minified versions of these files. To build the minified versions, do:

        npm run build

## Testing

Any time you're contributing to or hacking on code base, whether adding features or fixing issues, you should validate your changes don't break the core functionality of CourtListener by executing the test suite. This is also a great way to validate your development environment is properly configured. You should also add new tests for your new feature or fix.

In general, the easiest way to run the test suite is via Django's `test` command. In docker, that's:

```bash
docker exec -it cl-django python /opt/courtlistener/manage.py test --noinput cl
```

The `--noinput` flag tells Django to destroy any old test databases without prompting for confirmation (typically this is what you want).

The `cl` parameter is the name of the Python package to search for tests. It's not required, but a good habit to learn as you can more specifically specify tests by provided more details, such as `cl.search` to execute only tests in the search module.

Other useful flags are:

 - `--failfast`: This makes the test suite crash as soon as one test fails, instead of running the whole suite to completion.

 - `--keepdb`: Whenever tests are run, they generate a little DB on the side to run within by running all of your migrations. Using this flag keeps the DB between test runs, which can save some time.  

For more details, Django provides a lot of documentation on [testing in Django][django-testing]. Make sure to read the docs related to the current release used in CourtListener.

This can also be set up using Intellij and a Docker compose file.


### About the Types of Tests

There are a few different types of tests in the CourtListener test suite and can be generally categorized as follows in increasing complexity:

* **Unit Tests** that exercise core application logic and may require some level of access to the Django test database,

* **Solr Tests** that rely on the Apache Solr test cores to be online and have documents indexed for test execution,

* **Selenium Tests** that rely on the full-stack of Django, the database, and Solr to be available in order to test from the point of view of a web browser accessing the application.

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests should derive from `unittest.TestCase` or `django.test.TestCase` and run without a functioning Solr environment or Selenium functioning. These are the bread and butter of validating functions and business logic. You should contribute these when you write any new functions or update them when enhancing existing functions.

#### Solr Tests

Solr/search tests should derive from `cl.search.tests.EmptySolrTestCase` and use appropriate setup/teardown methods to populate the index by either manually creating model instances and passing the `index=True` attribute when calling `.save()` or calling the provided `cl.search.management.commands.cl_update_index` Django management command that will index the models from the database into the Solr cores.

#### Selenium Tests

Selenium tests should derive from `cl.tests.base.BaseSeleniumTest`, which automatically handles the setup and teardown of a Selenium webdriver instance available at `self.browser` from within your test code.

There are some helper methods provided via `BaseSeleniumTest` as well:
* `reset_browser()` - start a new browser session
* `click_link_for_new_page(link_text, timeout)` - a wrapper around the Selenium functions for finding an anchor based on the anchor text and calling click(), but also does an explicit wait up until _timeout_ seconds for the browser page to change. Use when expecting a navigation event.
* `attempt_sign_in(username, password)` - from a given CL page, will attempt to use the _Sign in / Register_ link and input the given username and password.
* `get_url_and_wait(url, timeout)` - will input the given url into the browser's address bar, submit, and wait until _timeout_ seconds for the given url to load.
* `assert_text_in_body(text)` - attempts to find the given text in the body of the current web page, failing the test if not found
* `assert_text_not_in_body(text)` - similar to previous, but tests that text is NOT in the body, failing if it's found.
* `extract_result_count_from_serp()` - if on the search result page, will attempt to find and parse the total results found count into a number and return it.

##### Viewing the Remote Selenium Browser

You can watch the remote selenium browser using VNC. To do so, start a VNC client, and then connect to:

    0.0.0.0:5900

The password is `secret`. Make sure that `SELENIUM_HEADLESS` is set to `False` or else you'll see nothing.

With those things done, run some tests and watch as it goes!

##### Increasing the Test Timeouts

The Selenium tests are wrapped with a timeout annotation that will fail them if they take too long to run. If you need to increase, or even want to decrease, this value then the easiest step is to set the `SELENIUM_TIMEOUT` environment variable to the given time in seconds.

For example, for a 2 minute timeout, you might do the following on Linux (or within the FreeLawBox):

```bash
export SELENIUM_TIMEOUT=120
```

##### Taking Screenshots on Failure

While a little flaky at the moment, most Selenium tests will be able to take a screenshot of the browser window on a failure.

To enable screenshots, simply define a `SELENIUM_DEBUG` environment variable set to anything. It's presence indicates it's enabled.

```bash
export SELENIUM_DEBUG=1
```

That will create screenshots at the end of every test as part of the `tearDown` method. If you want screenshots at other times, you can always add a line like:

    self.browser.save_screenshot('/tmp/' + filename)

Screenshots will be saved into the `cl-django` container. To grab them, [you can use][cp] `docker cp`. On GitHub, *if* the tests fail, these are stored as an "artifact" of the build, and you can download them to inspect them.

[cp]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/22050116/64911


### How to update a docker image.

Once an amazing new feature has been added to CL or to an import dependency (ie Juriscraper) one might need to update the docker image.

To do this:

1) Update the version numbers and version logs in `docker/django/version.txt` & `docker/task-server/version.txt`.
2) Push to `master`

Docker hub, automatically builds new versions and will update `:latest`.


### CI/CD

We use Github Actions to run the full test and linting suite on every push. If the tests fail or your code is not formatted properly according to our linters, your code probably won't get merged.
